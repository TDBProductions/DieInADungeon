1|1|Affect Normal Fires|This spell enables the magic-user to cause small fires - from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as a normal bonfire of 3' maximum diameter - to reduce in size and light to become match-like or increase in light so as to become as bright as a light spell. Reducing the fire will cut fuel consumption to half normal, and increasing the fire will double consumption. Note that heat output is not altered in either case!|0.1|n|VS|None
1|2|Burning Hands|"When the magic-user casts this spell, jets of searing flame shoot from his or her fingertips. Hands can only be held so
as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames, as the magic-user's thumbs must touch each other and fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 3' length in a horizontal arc of about 120° in front of the magic-user. Any creature in the area of flames takes 1 hit point of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster, and no saving throw is possible. Inflammable materials touched by the fire will burn, i.e. cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, etc."|0.1|1|VS|None
1|3|Charm Person|"This spell will affect any single person it is cast upon. The creature then will regard the druid who cast the spell as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the wizard to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the wizard will be viewed in its most favourable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the wizard if assured that the only chance to save the druid's life is if the creature holds back an onrushing red dragon for ""just a round or two"". Note also that the spell does not empower the druid with linguistic capabilities beyond those he or she normally possesses. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a saving throw is made, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's intelligence: "|0.1|Special|VS|Neg.
1|4|Comprehend Languages|" When this spell is cast, the magic-user is able to read an otherwise incomprehensible written message such as a treasure map (but not a magical writing, other than to know it is ""magic"") or understand the language of a speaking creature. In either case, the magic-user must touch the object to be read or the creature to be understood, and the spell does not enable the spell caster to write or speak the language. The material components of this spell are a pinch of soot and a few grains of salt. The reverse, Confuse Languages, prevents comprehension or cancels a Comprehend Languages spell. "|1|5n|VSM|None
1|5|Dancing Lights|"When a dancing lights spell is cast, the magic-user creates, at his or her option, from 1 to 4 lights which resemble either A) torches and/or lanterns (and cast that amount of light), B) glowing spheres of light (such as evidenced by will-o-wisps), or C) one faintly glowing, vaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar to that of a creature from the Elemental Plane of Fire. The Dancing Lights move as the spell caster desires, forward or back, straight or turning corners, without concentration upon such movement by the magic-user. The spell will wink out if the range or duration is exceeded. Range is a base of 4"" plus 1"" for each level of the magic-user who cast the spell. Duration is 2 melee rounds per level of the spell caster . The material component of this spell is either a bit of phosphorus or wytchwood or a glowworm. "|0.1|2n|VSM|None
1|6|Detect Magic|"When the Detect Magic spell is cast, the cleric detects magical radiations in a path 1"" wide, and up to 3"", long, in the direction he or she is facing. The caster can turn 60° per round. Note that stone walls of 1' or more thickness, solid metal of but 1/12' thickness, or 3' or more of solid wood will black the spell. The spell requires the use of the cleric's holy (or unholy) symbol."|0.1|2n|VS|None
1|7|Enlarge|" This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object. Enlargement causes increase in both size and weight. It can be cast upon only a single creature or object. Spell range is ½"" for each level of experience of the magic-user, and its duration is 1 turn per level of power experience of the spell caster . The effect of the enlargement spell is to increase the size of a living creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) by 20% per level of experience of the magic-user, with a maximum additional growth of 200%. The effect on objects is one-half that of creatures, i.e. 10% per level to a 100% maximum additional enlargement. The creature or object must be seen in order to effect the spell. The maximum volume of living material which can be initially affected is 10 cubic feet - for non-living matter, 5 cubic feet - per level of the magic-user. While magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge +1 sword is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. - weight, mass and strength are. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective; a hurled stone would have more mass (and be more hurtful providing enlargement took place just prior to impact): chains would be more massive; doors thicker; a thin line turned to a sizable, longer rope; and so on. Likewise, a person 12' tall would be as an ogre, while an 18' tall person would actually be a giant for the duration of the spell. The reverse spell, Reduce, will negate the effects or actually make creatures or objects smaller in the tame ratios as the regular spell application functions. Unwilling victims of the spell. or its reverse, are entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful, indicates the magic does not function, and the spell is wasted. The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron.  "|0.1|10n|VS|Neg.
1|8|Erase|The Erase spell removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or one or two pages or sheets of paper, parchment or similar surfaces. It will not remove Explosive Runes or a Symbol (see these spells hereafter), however. There is a basic chance of 50%, plus 2% per level of experience of the spell caster with respect to magical writings, plus 4% per level for mundane writing, that the spell will take effect. This represents the saving throw, and any percentile dice score in excess of the adjusted percentage chance means the spell fails.|0.1|P|VS|Neg.
1|9|Feather Fall|"When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a feathery piece of down. Rate of falling is thus instantly changed to a mere constant 2' per second or 12' per segment, and no damage is incurred when landing when the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the magic-user or some other creature or object up to the maximum range of 1"" per level of experience of the spell caster. it lasts for 1 segment for each level of the magic-user. The Feather Fall affects an area of 1 cubic inch, and the maximum weight of creatures and/or objects cannot exceed a combined total equal to a base 2,000 gold pieces weight plus 2,000 gold pieces weight per level of the spell caster. Example: a 2nd level magic-user has a range of 2"", a duration of 2 segments, a weight maximum of 6,000 gold pieces (600 pounds) when employing the spell. The spell works only upon free-falling or propelled objects. It will not affect a sword blow or a charging creature, but it will affect a missile. The material component is a small feather or a piece of down somewhere on the person of the spell caster. When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a feathery piece of down.

The material component is a small feather or a piece of down somewhere on the person of the spell caster. "|0.01|0.1n|VM|None
1|10|Friends| A Friends spell causes the magic-user to gain a temporary increase of 2-8 points in charisma - or a temporary lowering of charisma by 1-4 points - depending on whether creatures within the area of effect of the spell make - or fail - their saving throw versus magic. Those that fail their saving throw will be very impressed with the spell caster and desire greatly to be his or her friend and help. Those that do not fail will be uneasy in the spell caster's presence and tend to find him or her irritating. Note that this spell has absolutely no effect on creatures of animal intelligence or lower. The components for this spell are chalk (or white flour), lampblack (or soot), and vermilion applied to the face before casting the spell. |0.1|n|VSM|Special
1|11|Hold Portal|This spell magically bars a door, gate or valve of wood, metal or stone. The magical closure holds the portal fast just as if it were securely stopped and locked. The range of the spell is 2' per level of experience of the caster, and it lasts for 1 round per level. Note that any extra-dimensional creature (demon, devil, elemental, etc.) will shatter such a held portal. A magic-user of four or more experience levels higher than the spell caster can open the held portal at will. A Knock spell (q.v.) or Dispel Magic spell (q.v.) will negate the Hold Portal. Held portals can be broken or battered down. |0.1|n|V|None
1|12|Identify|When an Identify spell is cast, one item may be touched and handled by the magic-user in order that he or she may possibly find what dweomer it possesses. The item in question must be held or worn as would be normal for any such object. i.e. a bracelet must be placed on the spell caster's wrist, a helm on his or her head, boots on the feet, a cloak worn, a dagger held, and so on. Note that any consequences of this use of the item fall fully upon the magic-user, although any saving throw normally allowed is still the privilege of the magic-user. For each segment the spell is in force, it is 15% + 5% per level of the magic-user probable that 1 property of the object touched can become known - possibly that the item has no properties and is merely a ruse (the presence of Nystul's Magic Aura or a Magic Mouth being detected). Each time a property can be known, the referee will secretly roll to see if the magic-user made his or her saving throw versus magic. If the save was successful, the property is known; if it is 1 point short, a false power will be revealed; and if it is lower than 1 under the required score no information will be gained. The item will never reveal its exact plusses to hit or its damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many such plusses can be discovered. If it has charges, the object will never reveal the exact number, but it will give information which is +/-25% of actual i.e. a wand with 40 charges could feel as if it had 30, or 50, or any number in between. The item to be identified must be examined by the magic-user within 1 hour per level of experience of the examiner after it has been discovered, or all readable impressions will have been blended into those of the characters who have possessed it since. After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the magic-user loses 8 points of constitution. He or she must rest for 6 turns per 1 point in order to regain them. If the 8 point loss drops the spell caster below a constitution of 3, he or she will fall unconscious, and consciousness will not be regained until full constitution is restored 24 hours later. The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100g.p. value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk and a live miniature carp swallowed whole prior to spell casting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, probability increases 25% and all saving throws are made at +4. |10|0.1n|VSM|Special
1|13|Jump| When this spell is cast, the individual is empowered to leap up to 30' forward or 10' backward or straight upward. Horizontal leaps forward or backward are in only a slight arc - about 2'/10' of distance travelled. The Jump spell does not insure any safety in landing or grasping at the end of the leap. For every 3 additional levels of experience of the magic-user beyond the 1st, he or she is able to empower 1 additional leap, so a 4th level magic-user can cast a Jump spell which enables the recipient to make 2 leaps, 3 leaps at 7th level, etc. All leaps must be completed within 1 turn after the spell is cast, for after that period has elapsed the spell wears off. The material component of this spell is a grasshopper's hind leg, one for each leap, to be broken when the leap is made.|0.1|Special|VSM|None
1|14|Light|" This spell causes excitation of molecules so as to make them brightly luminous. The light thus caused is equal to torch light in brightness, but its sphere is limited to 4"" in diameter. It lasts for the duration indicated (7 turns at 1st experience level, 8 at 2nd, 9 at 3rd, etc.) or until the caster utters a word to extinguish the light. The Light spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions, except the blackness persists for only one half the duration that light would last. If this spell is cast upon a creature, the applicable magic resistance and saving throw dice rolls must be made. Success indicates that the spell affects the area immediately behind the creature, rather than the creature itself. In all other cases, the spell takes effect where the caster directs as long as he or she has a line of sight or unobstructed path for the spell; fight can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. "|0.1|10n|VS|None
1|15|Magic Missile|"Use of the Magic Missile spell creates one or more magical missiles which dart forth from the magic-user's fingertip and unerringly strike their target. Each missile does 2 to 5 hit points (d4+1) of damage. If the magic-user has multiple missile capability, he or she can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired. For each level of experience of the magic-user, the range of his or her Magic Missile extends 1"" beyond the 6"" base range. For every 2 levels of experience, the magic-user gains an additional missile, i.e. 2 at 3rd level, 3 at 5th level, 4 at 7th level, etc."|0.1|Special|VS|None
1|16|Mending|This spell repairs small breaks in objects. It will weld a broken ring, chain link, medallion or slender dagger, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or wineskin is completely healed over by a mending spell. This spell will not repair magic items of any kind. The material components of this spell are two small magnets of any type (lodestone in all likelihood) or two burrs. |0.1|P|VSM|None
1|17|Message|When this spell is cast, the magic-user can whisper a message and secretly, or openly, point his or her finger while so doing, and the whispered message will travel in a straight line and be audible to the creature pointed at. The message must fit spell duration, and if there is time remaining, the creature who received the message can whisper a reply and be heard by the spell caster. Note that there must be an open and unobstructed path between the spell caster and the recipient of the spell. The material component of the spell is a short piece of copper drawn fine.|0.1|0.5+0.1n|VSM|None
1|18|Nystul's Magic Aura| By means of this spell any one item of a weight of 50 g.p. per level of experience of the spell caster can be given an aura which will be noticed if detection of magic is exercised upon the object. If the object bearing the Nystul's Magic Aura is actually held by the creature detecting for a dweomer, he, she or it is entitled to a saving throw versus magic, and if this throw is successful, the creature knows that the aura has been placed to mislead the unwary. Otherwise, the aura is simply magical, but no amount of testing will reveal what the magic is. The component for this spell is a small square of silk which must be passed over the object to bear the aura. |1|n days|VSM|Special
1|19|Protection from Evil|"When this spell is cast, it acts as if it were a magical armour upon the recipient. The protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or conjured nature such as aerial servants, demons, devils, djinn, efreet, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, night hags, quasits, salamanders, water weirds, wind walkers, and xorn. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected creature. Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by evil creatures incur a penalty of -2 from dice rolls ""to hit"" the protected creature, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected creature's dice. This spell can be reversed to become Protection From Good, although it still keeps out enchanted evil creatures as well. To complete this spell, the cleric must truce a 3' diameter circle upon the floor (or ground) with holy water for Protection From Evil, with blood for Protection From Good - or in the air using burning incense or smouldering dung with respect to evil/good. "|0.1|2n|VSM|None
1|20|Push|Upon pronouncing the syllables of this spell, the magic-user causes an invisible force to strike against whatever object he or she is pointing at. The force of the Push is not great, being 1 foot- pound per level of the magic-user casting the spell, but it can move small objects up to 1' in a direction directly away from the caster, topple an object under the proper conditions, or cause a creature to lose its balance. An example of the latter use is causing a creature attacking to lose its balance when it is attacking, for if the creature fails its saving throw, it will not be able to attack that round. Of course, the mass of the creature attacking cannot exceed the force of the Push by more than a factor of 50, i.e. a 1st level magic-user cannot effectively push a creature weighing more than 50 pounds. A Push spell employed against an object held by a creature will cause it to subtract the force of the spell in foot- pounds (1,2,3, etc.) from its chance to hit or add to opponent saving throws as applicable if the creature fails to make its saving throw against magic when the spell is cast. The material component of this spell is a small pinch of powdered brass which must be blown from the palm prior to pointing at the object of the spell.|0.1|I|VSM|Neg.
1|21|Read Magic|By means of a Read Magic spell, the magic-user is able to read magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls weapons and the like - which would otherwise be totally unintelligible to him or her. (The personal books of the magic-user, and works already magically read, are intelligible.) This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a curse scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the magic-user has read the magical inscription, he or she is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of the Read Magic spell. The duration of the spell is 2 rounds per level of experience of the spell caster. The material component for the spell is a clear crystal or mineral prism. Note that the material is not expended by use. The reverse of the spell, Unreadable Magic, makes such writing completely unreadable to any creature, even with the aid of a Read Magic, until the spell wears off or the magic is dispelled. The material components for the reverse spell are a pinch of dirt and a drop of water.|1|2n|VSM|None
1|22|Shield|When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier before the front of the magic-user comes into being. This Shield will totally negate magic missile attacks. It provides the equivalent protection of armour class 2 against hand hurled missiles (axes, darts, javelins, spears, etc.), armour class 3 against small device-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts, bullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.), and armour class 4 against all other forms of attack. The Shield also adds +1 to the magic-user's saving throw dice vs. attacks which are basically frontal. Note that all benefits of the spell accrue only to attacks originating from the front facing the magic-user, where the Shield can move to interpose itself properly.|0.1|5n|VS|None
1|23|Shocking Grasp|When the magic-user casts this spell, he or she develops a powerful electrical charge which gives a jolt to the creature touched. The Shocking Grasp delivers from 1 to 8 hit points damage (d8), plus 1 hit point per level of the magic-user, i.e. a 2nd level magic-user would discharge a shock causing 3 to 10 hit points of damage. While the magic-user must only come close enough to his or her opponent to lay a hand on the opponent's body or upon an electrical conductor which touches the opponent's body, a like touch from the opponent does not discharge the spell. |0.1|I|VS|None
1|24|Sleep|"When a magic-user casts a Sleep spell, he or she will usually cause a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures [other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. MONSTER MANUAL) from the spell's effects]. All creatures to be affected by the Sleep spell must be within a 3"" diameter circle. The number of creatures which can be affected is a function of their life energy levels."|0.1|5n|VSM|None
1|25|Spider Climb|" A Spider Climb spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces just as a giant spider is able to do, i.e. at 3"" movement rate, or even hang upside down from ceilings. Note that the affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in this manner. During the course of the spell the recipient cannot handle objects which weigh less than 50 g.p., for such objects will stick to the creature's hands/feet, so a magic-user will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a Spider Climb dweomer. The material components of this spell are a drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of which must be eaten by the spell recipient. "|0.1|1+n|VSM|None
1|26|Tenser's Floating Disc|"With this spell, the caster creates the circular plane of null-gravity known as Tenser's Floating Disc after the famed wizard of that appellation (whose ability to locate treasure and his greed to recover every copper found are well known). The disc is concave, 3' in diameter, and holds 1,000 g.p. weight per level of the magic-user casting the spell. The disc floats at approximately 3' above the ground at all times and remains level likewise. It maintains a constant interval of 6' between itself and the magic-user if unbidden. It will otherwise move within its range, as well as along with him at a rate of 6"", at the command of the magic-user. If the spell caster moves beyond range, or if the spell duration expires, the floating disc winks out of existence and whatever it was supporting is precipitated to the surface beneath it. The material component of the spell is a drop of mercury. "|0.1|30+10n|VSM|None
1|27|Unseen Servant|The Unseen Servant is a non-visible valet, a butler to step and fetch, open doors and hold chairs, as well as to clean and mend. The spell creates a force which is not strong, but which obeys the command of the magic-user. It can carry only light-weight items - a maximum of 200 gold pieces weight suspended, twice that amount moving across a relatively friction-free surface such as a smooth stone or wood floor. It can only open normal doors, drawers, lids, etc. The Unseen Servant cannot fight nor can it be killed, as it is a force rather than a creature. It can be magically dispelled, or eliminated after taking 6 hit points of magical damage. The material components of the spell are a piece of string and a bit of wood. |0.1|60+10n|VSM|None
1|28|Ventriloquism| This spell enables the magic-user to make it sound as if his or her voice - or someone's voice or similar sound - is issuing from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. The spell caster is able to make his or her voice sound as if a different creature were speaking or making the noise; of course, in a language known by him or her, or a sound which the caster can normally make. With respect to such voices and sounds, there is a 10% chance per point of intelligence above 12 of the hearer that the ruse will be recognized. The material component of the spell is a small cone of parchment. |0.1|2+n|VM|None
1|29|Write|By means of this spell a magic-user might be able to inscribe a spell to make a magical scroll he or she cannot understand at the time (due to level or lack of sufficient intelligence) into the tome or other compilation he or she employs to maintain a library of spells. The magic-user must make a saving throw versus magic to attempt the writing of any spell, +2 if it is only up to 1 level greater than he or she currently uses, 0 at 2 levels higher, and -1 per level from 3 levels higher onwards. If this throw fails, the magic user is subject to 1d4 of damage for every level of the spell he or she was attempting to transcribe into his or her magic book, and furthermore be knocked unconscious for a like number of turns. This damage, if not fatal, can only be healed at the rate of 1-4 points per day, as it is damage to psyche and body. Furthermore, a spell will take 1 hour per level to transcribe in this fashion, and during this period, the magic-user is in a trance state and can always be surprised by any foe. In addition to the writing surface upon which the spell is to be transcribed, the spell caster needs a fine ink composed of rare substances (minimum cost 200 g.p. per bottle, if available at all without manufacture by the magic user). |1|n hours|VSM|Special
2|1|Audible Glamer|When the Audible Glamour spell is cast, the magic-user causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he or she desires (within range), and seeming to recede, close, or remain in a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound caused, however, is directly related to the level of the spell caster. The relative noise is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 3rd level. The noise of the Audible Glamour at this level is that of 4 men, maximum. Each additional experience level adds a like volume, so at 4th level the magic-user can have the spell cause sound equal to that of 8 men, maximum. Thus, talking, singing, or shouting, and/or walking, marching or running sounds can be caused. The auditory illusion created by an Audible Glamour spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the magic-user casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the some volume as 8 men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men. If a character states that he or she does not believe the sound, a saving throw is made, and if it succeeds, the character then hears nothing, or possibly just a faint sound. Note that this spell is particularly effective when cast in conjunction with Phantasmal Force (see below). The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax. |0.2|2n|VM|Special
2|2|Continual Light|This spell is similar to a Light spell, except that it lasts until negated (by a Continual Darkness or Dispel Magic spell) and its brightness is very great, being nearly as illuminating as full daylight. It can be cast into air, onto an object, or at a creature, In the third case, the Continual Light affects the space about one foot behind the creature if the latter makes its saving throw. Note that this spell will blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the visual organs, for example. Its reverse causes complete absence of light. |0.2|P|VS|None
2|3|Darkness, r=15'|This spell causes total, impenetrable darkness in the area of its effect. Infravision or ultravision are useless. Neither normal nor magical light will work unless a Light or Continual Light spell is used. In the former event, the darkness spell is negated by the Light spell and vice versa. The material components of this spell area bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.|0.2|10+n|VM|None
2|4|Detect Evil|": This is a spell which discovers emanations of evil, or of good in the case of the reverse spell, from any creature or object. For example, evil alignment or an evilly cursed object will radiate evil, but a hidden trop or an unintelligent viper will not. The duration of a Detect Evil (or Detect Good) spell is 1 turn + ½ turn (5 rounds, or 5 minutes) per level of the cleric. Thus a cleric of 1st level of experience can cast a spell with a 1½ turn duration, at 2nd level a 2 turn duration, 2½ at 3rd, etc. The spell has a path of detection 1"" wide in the direction in which the cleric is facing. It requires the use of the cleric's holy (or unholy) symbol as its material component, with the cleric holding it before him or her. "|0.2|5n|VS|None
2|5|Detect Invisibility|" When the magic-user casts a Detect Invisibility spell, he or she is able to clearly see any objects which are invisible, as well as astral, ethereal, hidden, invisible or out of phase creatures. Detection is in the magic-user's line of sight along a 1"" wide path to the range limit. The material components of this spell are a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver."|0.2|5n|VSM|None
2|6|ESP|When an ESP spell is used, the caster is able to detect the surface thoughts of any creatures in range - except creatures with no mind (as we know it), such as all of the undead. The ESP is stopped by 2 or more feet of rock, 2 or more inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead foil. The magic-user employing the spell is able to probe the surface thoughts of 1 creature per turn, getting simple instinctual thoughts from lower order creatures. Probes can continue on the same creature from round to round. The caster can use the spell to help determine if some creature lurks behind a door, for example, but the ESP will not always reveal what sort of creature it is. The material component of this spell is a copper piece.|0.2|n|VSM|None
2|7|Fools Gold|" Copper coins can temporarily be changed to gold pieces, or brass items turned to solid gold for the spell duration by means of this dweomer. Note that a huge amount of copper or brass can be turned to gold by the spell - assume 4,000 g.p. are equal to a cubic foot for purposes of this spell. Any creature viewing Fools Gold is entitled to a saving throw which must be equal to or less than its intelligence score, but for every level of the magic-user the creature must add 1 to his dice score, so it becomes unlikely that Fools Gold will be detected if it was created by a high level caster. If the ""gold"" is struck hard by an object of cold-wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will revert to its natural state, depending on the material component used to create the ""gold"": if a 50 g.p. citrine is powdered and sprinkled over the metal to be changed, the chance that cold iron will return it to its true nature is 30%; if a 100 g.p. amber stone is powdered, there is a 25% chance that iron will dispel the dweomer; if a 500 g.p. topaz is powdered, the chance drops to 10%; and if a 1,000 g.p. oriental (corundum) topaz is powdered, there is only a 1% chance that the cold iron will reveal that it is Fools Gold,"|1|n hours|VSM|None
2|8|Forget|By means of this dweomer the spell caster causes creatures within the area of effect to forget the events of the previous round (1 minute of time from the utterance of the spell back). For every 3 levels of experience of the spell caster another minute of past time is forgotten. Naturally, Forget in no way negates any Charm, Suggestions, Geases, Quests, or similar spells, but it is possible that the creature who caused such magic to be placed upon the victim of a Forget spell could be forgotten by this means. From 1-4 individual creatures can be affected by the spell, at the discretion of the caster. If only 1 is to be affected, the recipient saves versus magic at -2 on the dice; if 2 are spell objects, they save at -1; and if 3 or 4 are to be made to forget by this dweomer, they save normally. A clerical Heal or Restoration spell, specially cast for this purpose, will restore the lost memories, as will a Wish, but other means will not serve to do so. |0.2|P|VS|Neg.
2|9|Invisibility|This spell causes the recipient to vanish from sight and not be detectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced with respect to noises normal to it. The spell remains In effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, or the magic-user or the other recipient cancels it or until he, she or it attacks any creature. Thus, the spell caster or recipient could open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if any form of attack is made, the invisible creature immediately becomes visible, although this will allow the first attack by the creature because of the former invisibility. Even the allies of the spell recipient cannot see the invisible creature, or his, her or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Note that all highly intelligent creatures with 10 or more hit dice, or levels of experience, or the equivalent in intelligence/dice/levels have a chance to automatically detect invisible objects. The material components of the Invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter. |0.2|Special|VSM|None
2|10|Knock|The Knock spell will open stuck or held or wizard-locked doors. It will also open barred or otherwise locked doors. It causes secret doors to open. The Knock spell will also open locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It will loose shackles or chains as well. If it is used to open a wizard-locked door, the Knock does not remove the former spell, but it simply suspends its functioning for 1 turn. In all other cases, the Knock will permanently open locks or welds - although the former could be closed and locked again thereafter. It will not raise bars or similar impediments (such as a portcullis). The spell will perform two functions, but if a door is locked, barred, and held, opening it will require two Knock spells. |0.1|Special|V|None
2|11|Leomund's Trap|"This false trap is designed to fool the dwarf and/or thief attempting to pilfer or otherwise steal the spell caster's goods. It enables the magic-user to place a dweomer upon any small mechanism or device such as a lock, hinge, hasp, screw-on cap, ratchet, etc. Any examination by a character able to detect traps will be 100% likely to note the Leomund's Trap and believe it to be real. This probability reduces by 4% for each level of experience of the examiner beyond the first. If the supposed ""trap"" is then to be removed, it is only 20% likely that the creature attempting it will believe he or she has succeeded, +4% probability per level of experience of the remover. Of course, the spell is illusory, nothing will happen if the trap is ignored, and its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time. The material component of the spell is a piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to be ""trapped"". Only one Leomund's Trap may be placed within a 50' by 50' area "|0.3|P|VSM|None
2|12|Levitate| When a Levitate spell is cast, the magic-user can place it upon his or her person, or upon some other creature, subject to a maximum weight limit of 1,000 gold pieces equivalence per level of experience, i.e., a third level magic user can Levitate up to 300 pounds (3,000 g.p.) maximum. If the spell is cast upon the person of the magic-user, he or she can move vertically at a rate of 20' per round. If cast upon another creature, the magic-user can levitate it at a maximum vertical movement of 10' per round. Horizontal movement is not empowered by this spell, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, far example, to move laterally. The spell caster can cancel the spell as desired. If the recipient of the spell is unwilling, that creature is entitled to a saving throw to determine if the Levitate spell affects it. The material component of this spell is either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end. |0.2|10n|VSM|Neg.
2|13|Locate Object|"This spell aids in location of a known or familiar object. The cleric casts the spell, slowly turns, and knows when he or she is facing in the direction of the object to be located, provided the object is within range, i.e. 7"" for 1st level clerics, 8"" for 2nd, 9"" for 3rd, etc, The casting requires the use of a piece of lodestone, The spell will locate such objects as apparel, jewellery, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder or stairway. By reversal (obscure object), the cleric is able to hide an object from location by spell, crystal ball, or similar means. Neither application of the spell will affect a living creature. "|0.2|n|VSM|None
2|14|Magic Mouth|"When this spell is cast, the magic-user empowers the chosen object with an enchanted mouth which suddenly appears and speaks the message which the spell caster imparted upon the occurrence of a specified event. The Magic Mouth can speak any message of 25 words or less in a language known by the spell caster, over a 1 turn period from start to finish. It cannot speak magic spells. The mouth moves to the words articulated, so if it is placed upon a statue, for example, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the Magic Mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door or any other object excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. The spell will function upon specific occurrence according to the command of the spell caster, i.e. speak to the first creature that touches you - or to the first creature that passes within 30'. Command can be as general or specific and detailed as desired, such as the following: ""Speak only when an octogenerian female human carrying a sack of great clusters sits cross legged within 1'."" Command range is 1½"" per level of the magic-user, so a 6th level magic-user can command the Magic Mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 3"", i.e. ""Speak when a winged creature comes within 3"" "". Until the speak command can be fulfilled, the Magic Mouth will remain in effect, thus spell duration is variable. A Magic Mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level or hit dice, nor class, except by external garb. The material component of this spell is a small bit of honeycomb. "|0.2|Special|VSM|None
2|15|Mirror Image|When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spell caster causes from 1 to 4 exact duplicates of himself or herself to come into being around his or her person. These images do exactly what the magic-user does, and as the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is effected, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the phantasms and which is the actual magic-user. When an image is struck by a weapon, magical or otherwise, it disappears. but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images seem to shift from round to round, so that if the actual magic-user is struck during one round, he or she cannot be picked out from amongst his or her images the next. To determine the number of images which appear, roll percentile dice, and add 1 to the resulting score for each level of experience of the magic-user: 25 or less = 1 mirror image, 26-50 = 2, 51-75 = 3, 75 or more = 4. At the expiration of the spell duration all images wink out. |0.2|2n|VS|None
2|16|Pyrotechnics|" A Pyrotechnics spell can have either of two effects. It produces a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, coloured aerial fireworks which lasts 1 segment per experience level of the druid casting the spell and temporarily blinds those creatures in the area of effect or under it or within 12"" of the area (and in any event in unobstructed line of sight); or it causes a thick writhing stream of smoke to arise from the fire source of the spell and form a choking cloud which lasts for 1 round per experience level of the druid casting it, covering a roughly globular area from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area), which totally obscures vision beyond 2'. The spell requires a fire of some sort in range. The area of Pyrotechnics effect is 10 times the volume of the fire source with respect to fireworks, 100 times with respect to smoke. In either case, the fire source is immediately extinguished by the employment of the spell. "|0.2|Special|VS|None
2|17|Ray of Enfeeblement|By means of a Ray Of Enfeeblement, a magic-user weakens an opponent, reducing strength - and attacks which rely upon it by 25% or more. For every level of experience beyond the third of the magic-user casting the spell, there is an additional 2% strength reduction, so that at 4th level, strength loss is 27%. Range and duration of the spell are also dependent upon the level of experience of the spell caster. For example, if a creature is struck by a Ray Of Enfeeblement it will lose the appropriate percentage of hit points of damage it scores on physical attacks (missiles, thrusting/cutting/crushing weapons, biting, clawing, goring, kicking, constriction, etc.). Your referee will determine any other reductions appropriate to the affected creature. If the target creature makes its saving throw, the spell has no effect.|0.2|n|VS|Neg.
2|18|Rope Trick|When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5' to 30' in length, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole is hanging perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened in an extra-dimensional space, and the spell caster and up to five others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them. The rope cannot be taken into the extra-dimensional space if six persons have climbed it, but otherwise it can be pulled up. Otherwise, the rope simply hangs in air, and will stay there unless removed by some creature. The persons in the extra-dimensional space must climb down the rope prior to the expiration of the spell duration, or else they are dropped from the height to which they originally climbed when the effect of the spell wears out. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. Note that the Rope Trick spell allows climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the rope's upper end, which is in an extra-dimensional space. The material components of this spell are powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment. |0.2|20n|VSM|None
2|19|Scare|"When this spell is directed at any creature with fewer than 6 levels of experience/hit dice, it must save versus magic or fall into a fit of trembling and shaking. The frightened creature will not drop any items held unless it is encumbered. If cornered, the spell recipient will fight, but at -1 on ""to hit"" and damage dice rolls and all saving throws as well. Note that this spell does not have any effect on elves, half-elves, the undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, shadows, ghosts, wights, wraiths), larvae, lemures, manes, or clerics of any sort. The material component used for this spell is a bit of bone from an undead skeleton, zombie, ghoul, ghost or mummy. "|0.2|3d4 |VSM|Neg.
2|20|Shatter|" The Shatter spell affects non-magical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. Such objects are shivered into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects above 100 gold pieces weight equivalence per level of the spell caster are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition must save versus a ""crushing blow"" or be shattered. The material component of this spell is a chip of mica. "|0.2|P|VSM|Neg.
2|21|Stinking Cloud|"When a Stinking Cloud is cast, the magic-user causes a billowing mass of nauseous vapours to come into being up to 3"" distant from his or her position. Any creature caught within the cloud must save versus poison or be helpless due to nausea from 2 to 5 turns (d4 + 1). Those which make successful saving throws are helpless only for as long as they remain within the cloud, and for the round after they emerge, because of its irritating effects on visual and olfactory organs. The material component of the spell is a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves "|0.2|n|VSM|Special
2|22|Strength|Application of this spell increases the strength of the character by a number of points - or tenths of points after 18 strength is attained and the character is in the fighter class. Benefits of the strength spell last for the duration of the magic. The amount of additional strength accruing to a character upon whom this spell is cast depends upon his or her class and is subject to all restrictions on strength due to race, sex or class. |10|n hours|VSM|None
2|23|Web|" A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs, but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc. - diametrically opposed.
The Web spell covers a maximum area of 8 cubic inches, and the webs must be at least 1"" thick, so a mass 4"" high, 2"" wide, and 1"" deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck amongst the gluey fibres. Creatures with less than 13 strength must remain fast until freed by another or until the spell wears off. For every full turn entrapped by a Web, a creature has a 5% cumulative chance of suffocating to death. Creatures with strength between 13 and 17 can break through 1' of webs per turn. Creatures with 18 or greater strength break through 1' of webs per round. (N.B. Sufficient mass equates to great strength in this case, and great mass will hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures will break through 1' of webs per segment. It is important to note that the strands of a Web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword will slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - will set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within the webs will take 2-8 hit points of damage from the flames, but those freed of the strands will not be harmed. Saving throw is made at -2. If the saving throw versus Web is made, two results may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape then he is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape then the webs are only ½ strength. The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web."|0.2|20n|VSM|Neg.
2|24|Wizard Lock|When a Wizard Lock spell is cast upon a door, chest or portal, it magically locks it, The wizard-locked door or object can be opened only by breaking, a Dispel Magic, a Knock spell (qq.v.}, or by a magic-user 4 or more levels higher than the one casting the spell, Note that the last two methods do not remove the Wizard Lock, they only negate it for a brief duration. Creatures of extra-dimensional nature do not affect a Wizard Lock as they do a held portal (see Hold Portal).|0.2|P|VS|None
3|1|Blink|"By means of this spell, the magic-user causes his or her material form to ""blink"" out and back to this plane once again in random period and direction during the duration at each minute the spell is in effect. (Cf. ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL, Blink Dog.) The segment of the round that the spell caster ""blinks out"" is determined by random roll with 2d4, and during this same segment he or she will appear again 2' distant from his or her previous position. (Direction is determined by roll of d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) If some object is already occupying the space where the spell caster is indicated as ""blinking"" into, his or her form is displaced in a direction away from original (round starting) position for any distance necessary to appear in empty space, but never in excess of an additional 10'. If that extra distance still dictates the magic-user and another solid object are to occupy the same space, the spell caster is then trapped on the ethereal plane. During and after the blink segment of a round, the spell caster can be attacked only by opponents able to strike both locations at once, e.g. a breath weapon, Fireball, and similar wide area attack forms. Those not so able can only strike the magic-user if they managed to attack prior to the ""blink"" segment. The spell caster is only 75% likely to be able to perform any acts other than physical attack with a hand-held stabbing or striking weapon during the course of this spell. That is, use of any spell, device, or item might not be accomplished or accomplished in an incorrect manner or in the wrong direction. Your referee will determine success/failure and the results thereof according to the particular action being performed. "|0.1|n|VS|None
3|2|Clairaudience|"The Clairaudience spell enables the magic-user to concentrate upon some locale and hear in his or her mind whatever noise is within a 6"" radius of his or her determined Clairaudience locale centre. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known, i.e. a place familiar to the spell caster or an obvious one (such as behind a door, around a corner, in a copse of woods, etc.). Only sounds which are normally detectable by the magic-user can be heard by use of this spell. Only metal sheeting or magical protections will prevent the operation of the spell. Note that it will function only on the plane of existence an which the magic-user is at the time of casting. The material component of the spell is a small silver horn of at least 100 g.p. value, and casting the spell causes it to disappear. "|0.3|n|VSM|None
3|3|Clairvoyance|"Similar to the Clairaudience spell, the Clairvoyance spell empowers the magic-user to see in his or her mind whatever is within sight range from the spell locale chosen. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known - familiar or obvious. Furthermore, light is a factor whether or not the spell caster has the ability to see into the infrared or ultraviolet spectrums. If the area is dark, only a 1"" radius from the centre of the locale of the spell's area of effect can be clairvoyed; otherwise, the seeing extends to normal vision range. Metal sheeting or magical protections will foil a Clairvoyance spell. The spell functions only on the plane on which the magic-user is at the time of casting. The material component of the spell is a pinch of powdered pineal gland from a human or humanoid creature. "|0.3|n|VSM|None
3|4|Dispel Magic|When a cleric casts this spell, it neutralizes or negates the magic it comes in contact with as follows: A Dispel Magic will not affect a specially enchanted item such as a scroll, magic ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous magic item, magic weapon, magic shield, or magic armour. It will destroy magic potions (they are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell), remove spells cast upon persons or objects, or counter the casting of spells in the area of effect. The base chance for success of a Dispel Magic spell is 50%. For every level of experience of the character casting the Dispel Magic above that of the creature whose magic is to be dispelled (or above the efficiency level of the object from which the magic is issuing), the base chance increases by 5%, so that if there are 10 levels of difference, there is a 100% chance. For every level below the experience/efficiency level of the creature/object, the base chance is reduced by 2%. Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. It is automatic in negating the spell caster's own magic. |0.3|P|VS|None
3|5|Explosive Runes|By tracing the mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar instrument bearing written information, the magic-user prevents unauthorized reading of such. The explosive runes are difficult to detect, 5% per level of magic use experience of the reader, thieves having only a 5% chance in any event, When read, the Explosive Runes detonate, delivering a full 12 to 30 (6d4 + 6) hit points of damage upon the reader, who gets no saving throw, and either a like amount, or half that if saving throws are made, on creatures within the blast radius. The magic-user who cast the spell, as well as any other magic-users he or she instructs, can use the instrument without triggering the runes. Likewise, the magic-user can totally remove them whenever desired. They can otherwise be removed only by a Dispel Magic spell, and the Explosive Runes last until the spell is triggered. The instrument upon which the runes are placed will be destroyed when the explosion takes place unless it is not normally subject to destruction by magical fire. |0.3|Special|VS|Half
3|6|Feign Death|"By means of this spell, the caster or any other creature whose levels of experience/hit dice do not exceed the magic-user's own level can be put into a cataleptic state which is impossible to distinguish from actual death. Although the person/creature affected by the Feign Death spell can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is possible; thus, any wounding or mistreatment of the body will not be felt and no reaction will occur and damage will be only one-half normal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy level drain will not affect the individual/creature under the influence of this spell, but poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body will become effective when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted. Note that only a willing individual can be affected by Feign Death. The spell caster is able to end the spell effects at any time desired, but it requires 1 full round for bodily functions to begin again.
 "|0.1|6+n|VS|None
3|7|Fireball|A Fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar, and delivers damage proportionate to the level of the magic-user who cast it, i.e. 1 six-sided die (d6) for each level of experience of the spell caster. Exception: magic Fireball wands deliver 6 die fireballs (6d6), magic staves with this capability deliver 8 die Fireballs, and scroll spells of this type deliver a Fireball of from 5 to 10 dice (d6 + 4) of damage. The burst of the Fireball does not expend a considerable amount of pressure, and the burst will generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume. [The area which is covered by the Fireball is a total volume of roughly 33,000 cubic feet (or yards)]. Besides causing damage to creatures, the Fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the Fireball will melt soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Items exposed to the spell's effects must be rolled for to determine if they are affected. Items with a creature which makes its saving throw are considered as unaffected. The magic-user points his or her finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body prior to attaining the prescribed range, flowers into the Fireball. If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point damage from the blast. Those who make saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat or roll aside, taking ½ the full hit point damage - each and every one within the blast area. The material component of this spell is a tiny ball composed of bat guano and sulphur. |0.3|I|VS|Half
3|8|Flame Arrow|"Once the magic-user has cast this spell. he or she is able to touch one arrow or crossbow bolt (quarrel) per segment for the duration of the Flame Arrow. Each such missile so touched becomes magic, although it gains no bonuses ""to hit"". Each such missile must be discharged within 1 round, for after that period flame consumes it entirely, and the magic is lost. Fiery missiles will certainly have normal probabilities of causing combustion. and any creature subject to additional fire damage will suffer +1 hit point of damage from any flame arrow which hits it. The material components for this spell are a drop of oil and a small piece of flint."|0.3|n|VSM|None
3|9|Fly|"This spell enables the magic-user to bestow the power of magical flight. The creature affected is able to move vertically and/or horizontally at a rate of 12"" per move (half that if ascending, twice that if descending in a dive). The exact duration of the spell is always unknown to the spell caster, as the 1-6 turns variable addition is determined by the Dungeon Master secretly. The material component of the Fly spell is a wing feather of any bird. "|0.3|10+(d6)10|VSM|None
3|10|Gust of Wind|"When this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the magic-user and moves in the direction he or she is facing. The force of this Gust Of Wind is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It will cause protected -flames such as those of lanterns to wildly dance and has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spell caster to extinguish even such lights. It will also fan large fires outwards 1' to 6' in the direction of the wind's movement. It will force back small flying creatures 1"" to 6"" and cause man-sized ones to be held motionless if attempting to move into its force, and similarly slow large flying creatures by 50% for 1 round. It will blow over light objects. Its path is 1"" wide by 1"" of length per level of experience of the magic-user casting the Gust Of Wind spell i.e. an 8th level magic-user causes a Gust Of Wind which travels 8"". The material component of the spell is a legume seed. "|0.3|0.1|VSM|None
3|11|Haste|"When this spell is cast, affected creatures function at double their normal movement and attack rates. Thus, a creature moving at 6"" and attacking 1 time per round would move at 12"" and attack 2 times per round. Spell casting is not more rapid. The number of creatures which can be affected is equal to the level of experience of the magic-user, those creatures closest to the spell caster being affected in preference to those farther away, and all affected by Haste must be in the designated area of effect. Note that this spell negates the effects of a Slow spell (see hereafter). Additionally, this spell ages the recipients due to speeded metabolic processes. Its material component is a shaving of liquorice root. "|0.3|3+n|VSM|None
3|12|Hold Person| Similar to the second level cleric Hold Person (q.v.). this spell immobilizes creatures, within range, as designated by the magic-user. If three or four persons are attacked, their saving throws are normal; but if two are attacked, their saving throws are made at -1 and if only one creature is attacked, the saving throw versus the Hold Person spell is made at -3 on the die. Partial negation of a Hold Person spell, such as would be possible by a ring of spell turning, causes the spell to function as a Slow spell (q.v.) unless the saving throw is successful. Creatures affected by the spell are: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, and troglodytes.  |0.3|2n|V|Neg.
3|13|Infravision|"By means of this spell the magic-user enables the recipient of Infravision to see light in the infrared spectrum. Thus, differences in heat wave radiations can be seen up to 6"". Note that strong sources of infrared radiation (fire, lanterns, torches, etc.) tend to blind or cast ""shadows"" just as such light does with respect to normal vision, so the infravision is affected and does not function efficiently in the presence of such heat sources. (Invisible creatures are not usually detectable by infravision, as the infrared light waves are affected by invisibility, just as those of the ultraviolet and normal spectrums are.) The material component of this spell is either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate. "|1|n hours|VSM|None
3|14|Invisibility, r=10'| This spell causes a sphere of a radius equalling 10', with a touched creature at its origin, to vanish from sight and not be detectable by normal vision or even infravision. Affected creatures cannot see each other. Of course, the invisible creature(s) is(are) not magically silenced with respect to noises normal to it. The spell remains In effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, or the magic-user or the target cancels it or until he, she or it attacks any creature. Affected creatures only break their own invisibility by attacking, but if the target creature breaks invisibility the entire spell fails. Thus, the spell caster or recipient could open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if any form of attack is made, the invisible creature immediately becomes visible, although this will allow the first attack by the creature because of the former invisibility. Even the allies of the spell recipient cannot see the invisible creature, or his, her or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Note that all highly intelligent creatures with 10 or more hit dice, or levels of experience, or the equivalent in intelligence/dice/levels have a chance to automatically detect invisible objects. The material components of the Invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter.|0.3|Special|VSM|None
3|15|Leomund's Tiny Hut|When this spell is cast, the magic-user causes an opaque sphere of force to come into being around his or her person, half of the sphere projecting above the ground or floor surface, the lower hemisphere passing through the surface. This field causes the interior of the sphere to maintain at 70°F. temperature in cold to 0°F., and heat up to 105°F. Cold below 0° lowers inside temperature on a 1° for 1° basis, heat above 105° raises the inside temperature likewise. The Tiny Hut will withstand winds up to 50 m.p.h. without being harmed, but wind force greater than that will destroy it. The interior of the Tiny Hut is a hemisphere, and the spell caster can illuminate it dimly upon command, or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although the force field is opaque from positions outside, it is transparent from within. In no way will Leomund's Tiny Hut provide protection from missiles, weapons, spells, and the like. Up to 6 other man-sized creatures can fit into the field with its creator, and these others can freely pass in and out of the Tiny Hut without harming it, but if the spell caster removes himself from it, the spell will dissipate. The material component for this spell is a small crystal bead which will shatter when spell duration expires or the hut is otherwise dispelled. |0.3|n hours|VSM|None
3|16|Lightning Bolt|"Upon casting this spell, the magic user releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy which causes damage equal to 1 six-sided die (d6) for each level of experience of the spell caster to creatures within its area of effect, or 50% of such damage to such creatures which successfully save versus the attack form. The range of the bolt is the location of the commencement of the stroke, i.e. if shot to 6"", the bolt would extend from this point to n inches further distance. The Lightning Bolt will set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1' thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be made for objects which withstand the full force of a stroke (cf. fireball). The area of the Lightning Bolt's effect is determined by the spell caster, just as its distance is. The stroke can be either a forking bolt 1"" wide and 4"" long. or a single bolt ½"" wide and 8"" long. If a 12th level magic-user cast the spell at its maximum range, 16"" in this case, the stroke would begin at 16"" and flash outward from there, as a forked bolt ending at 20"" or a single one ending at 24"". If the full length of the stroke is not possible due to the interposition of a non-conducting barrier (such as a stone wall), the Lightning Bolt will double and rebound towards its caster, its length being the normal total from beginning to end of stroke, damage caused to interposing barriers notwithstanding. Example: An 8"" stroke is begun at a range of 4"", but the possible space in the desired direction is only 3½""; so the bolt begins at the 3½"" maximum, and it rebounds 8"" in the direction of its creator. The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal or glass rod. "|0.3|I|VSM|None
3|17|Monster Summoning I|Within 1-4 rounds of casting this spell, the magic-user will cause the appearance of from 2-8 first level monsters (selected at random by the referee, but whose number may be either randomly determined or selected personally by the referee, according to the strength of the monster randomly determined). These monsters will appear in the spot, within spell range, desired by the magic-user, and they will attack the spell user's opponents to the best of their ability until he or she commands that attack cease, or the spell duration expires, or the monsters ore slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if communication is possible, and if they are physically capable, perform other services for the summoning magic-user. The material components of this spell are a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle. |0.3|2+n|VSM|None
3|18|Phantasmal Force|When this spell is cast, the magic-user creates a visual illusion which will affect all believing creatures which view the Phantasmal Force, even to the extent of suffering damage from phantasmal missiles or from falling into an illusory pit full of sharp spikes Note that audial illusion is not a component of the spell. The illusion lasts until struck by an opponent - unless the spell caster causes the illusion to react appropriately - or until the magic-user ceases concentration upon the spell (due to desire, moving, or successful attack which causes damage). Creatures which disbelieve the Phantasmal Force gain a saving throw versus the spell, and if they succeed, they see it for what it is and add +4 to associates' saving throws if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures not observing the spell effect are immune until they view it. The spell can create the illusion of any object, or creature, or force, as long as it is within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. This area can move within the limits of the range. The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.|0.3|Special|VSM|Special
3|19|Protection from Evil, r=10'|"When this spell is cast, it acts as if it were a magical armour upon the recipient. The protection encircles the recipient at a ten foot distance, thus preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or conjured nature such as aerial servants, demons, devils, djinn, efreet, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, night hags, quasits, salamanders, water weirds, wind walkers, and xorn. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected creature. Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by evil creatures incur a penalty of -2 from dice rolls ""to hit"" the protected creature, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected creature's dice. This spell can be reversed to become Protection From Good, although it still keeps out enchanted evil creatures as well. To complete this spell, the cleric must truce a 3' diameter circle upon the floor (or ground) with holy water for Protection From Evil, with blood for Protection From Good - or in the air using burning incense or smouldering dung with respect to evil/good."|0.3|2n|VSM|None
3|20|Protection from Normal Missiles|By means of this spell, the magic-user bestows total invulnerability to hurled and projected missiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, small stones and spears. Furthermore, it causes a reduction of 1 from each die of damage inflicted by large and/or magical missiles such as ballista missiles, catapult stones, and magical arrows, bolts, javelins, etc. Note, however that this spell does not convey any protection from such magical attacks as Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, or Magic Missiles. The material component of this spell is a piece of tortoise or turtle shell. |0.3|10n|VSM|None
3|21|Slow|" A Slow spell causes affected creatures to move and attack at one half of the normal or current rate. Thus, it negates a Haste spell (q.v.), has cumulative effect if cast upon creatures already slowed, and otherwise affects magically speeded or slowed creatures. The magic will affect as many creatures as the spell caster has levels of experience, providing these creatures are within the area of effect determined by the magic-user, i.e. the 4"" x 4"" area which centres in the direction and at the range called for by the caster. The material component of this spell is a drop of treacle."|0.3|3+n|VSM|None
3|22|Suggestion|When this spell is cast by the magic-user, he or she influences the actions of the chosen recipient by utterance of a few words - phrases, or a sentence or two - suggesting a course of action desirable to the spell caster. The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the magic-user's suggestion, i.e., it must be spoken in a language which the spell recipient understands. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; a request asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act will automatically negate the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water, and a quick dip would be refreshing, is another matter; or the urging that a cessation of attack upon the magic-user's party would benefit a red dragon, for the group could loot a rich treasure elsewhere through co-operative action, is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power. The course of action of a Suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the recipient creature makes its saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion will cause the saving throw to be made at a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of your Dungeon Master. Undead are not subject to Suggestion. The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil. |0.3|n+1 hours|VM|Neg.
3|23|Tongues|This spell enables the wizard to speak the language of any creature inside the spell area, whether it is a racial tongue or an alignment language. The reverse of the spell cancels the effect of the Tongues spell or confuses verbal communication of any sort within the area of effect. |0.3|n|VM|None
3|24|Water Breathing|The recipient of a Water Breathing spell is able to freely breathe underwater for the duration of the spell, i.e. 6 turns for each level of experience of the druid casting the spell. The reverse, Air Breathing, allows water breathing creatures to comfortably survive in the atmosphere for an equal duration.|0.3|30n|VSM|None
4|1|Charm Monster| This spell is similar to a Charm Person spell (q.v.), but it will affect any living creature - or several creatures of lesser level as explained hereafter. The magic-user casts the Charm Monster spell, and any affected creature regards the spell caster as friendly, an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm. If communication is possible, the charmed creature will follow reasonable requests, instructions, or orders most faithfully (cf. Suggestion spell). Affected creatures will eventually come out from under the influence of the spell, and the probability of such breaking of a Charm Monster spell is a function of the creature's level, i.e. its number of hit dice. Naturally, overtly hostile acts by the person charming the monster will automatically break the spell, or at the very least allow the monster a new saving throw versus the charm. The spell will affect from 2-8 1st level creatures, 1-4 2nd level creatures, 1 or 2 3rd level, or 1 creature of 4th or higher le|0.4|Special|VS|Neg.
4|2|Confusion|"This spell causes Confusion in one or more creatures within spell range. (Confused creatures will react as follows: 01-10: Wander away for 1 turn; 11-60: Stand confused for 1 round; 61-80: Attack nearest creature for 1 round; 81-00: Attack druid or his party for 1 round.) The spell lasts for 1 melee round for each level of experience of the spell caster. It will affect 2 to 8 creatures, plus a possible additional number of creatures determined by subtracting the level or number of hit dice of the strongest opponent creature within the spell range and area of effect from the level of the druid who cast the spell of Confusion. If a positive number results, it is added to the random die roll result for number of creatures affected; a negative number is ignored. All creatures affected will be those closest to the druid within the area of effect. Each affected creature must make a saving throw each round, unless they are caused to ""wander away for 1 turn"" in which case they will go as far away from the druid as is possible in one turn of normal movement, as conditions permit. All saving throws are at -2. Confused creatures act according to the table of actions shown above, but saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. "|0.4|2+n|VSM|Special
4|3|Dig|A Dig spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round. The hole thus dug is a cube 5' per side. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the magic-user continues downward beyond 5', there is a chance that the pit will collapse: 15%/additional 5' in depth in earth, 35%/additional 5' depth in sand, and 55%/additional 5' depth in mud. Any creature at the edge (1') such a pit uses its dexterity score as a saving throw to avoid falling into the hole with a score equal to or less than the dexterity meaning that a fall was avoided. Any creature moving rapidly towards a pit area will fall in unless it saves versus magic. Any creature caught in the centre of a pit just dug will always fall in. The spell caster uses a miniature shovel and tiny bucket to activate a Dig spell and must continue to hold these material components while each pit is excavated. |0.4|n|VSM|Special
4|4|Dimension Door|" By means of a Dimension Door spell, the magic-user instantly transfers himself or herself up to 3"" distance per level of experience of the spell caster. This special form of teleportation allows for no error, and the magic-user always arrives at exactly the spot desired whether by simply visualizing the area (within spell transfer distance, of course) or by stating direction such as ""30 inches straight downwards,"" or ""upwards to the northwest, 45 degree angle, 42 inches."" If the magic-user arrives in a place which is already occupied by a solid body, he or she remains in the Astral Plane until located by some helpful creature willing to cast a Dispel Magic upon the person, for he or she is stunned and cannot successfully perform any spell casting. If distances are stated and the spell caster arrives with no support below his or her feet (i.e. in mid-air), falling and damage will result unless further magical means are employed. All that the magic-user wears or carries, subject to a maximum weight equal to 5,000 gold pieces of non-living matter, or half that amount of living matter, is transferred with the spell caster. Recovery from use of a Dimension Door spell requires 7 segments."|0.1|Special|V|None
4|5|Enchanted Weapon|This spell turns an ordinary weapon into a magical one, The weapon is the equivalent of a +1 weapon but has no bonuses whatsoever. Thus, arrows, axes, bolts, bows, daggers, hammers, maces, spears, swords, etc. can be made into enchanted weapons. Two small (arrows. bolts, daggers, etc.) or one large (axe, bow, hammer, mace, etc.) weapon can be affected by the spell. Note that successful hits by enchanted missile weapons cause the spell to be broken, but that otherwise the spell duration lasts until the time limit based on the level of experience of the magic-user casting it expires, i.e. 40 rounds (4 turns) in the case of an 8th level magic-user. The material components of this spell are powdered lime and carbon. |10|5n|VSM|None
4|6|Fear|When a Fear spell is cast, the magic-user sends forth an invisible ray which causes creatures within its area of effect to turn away from the spell caster and flee in panic. Affected creatures are likely to drop whatever they are holding when struck by the spell; the base chance of this is 60% at 1st level (or at 1 hit die), and each level (or hit die) above this reduces the probability by 5%, i.e. at 10th level there is only a 15% chance, and at 13th level 0% chance. Creatures affected by fear flee at their fastest rate for the number of melee rounds equal to the level of experience of the spell caster. The panic takes effect on the melee round following the spell casting, but dropping of items in hand will take place immediately. Of course, creatures which make their saving throws versus the spell are not affected. The material component of this spell is either the heart of a hen or a white feather. |0.4|Special|VSM|Neg.
4|7|Fire Charm|By means of this spell the magic-user causes a normal fire source such as a brazier, flambeau, or bonfire to serve as a magical agent, for from this source he or she causes a gossamer veil of multi-hued flame to circle the fire at 5' distance. Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of flame around it must save versus magic or be charmed into remaining motionless and gazing, transfixed at the flames. While so charmed, creatures are subject to Suggestion spells of 12 or fewer words, saving against their influence at -3. The Fire Charm is broken by any physical attack upon the charmed creature, if a solid object is interposed between the creature and the veil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or when the duration of the spell is at an end. Note that the veil of flame is not a magical fire, and passing through it incurs the same type and amount of damage as would be sustained from passing through its original fire source. The material component for this spell is a small piece of multicoloured silk of exceptional thinness which the dweomercraefter must throw into the fire source. |0.4|2n|VSM|Neg.
4|8|Fire Shield|"By casting this spell the magic-user appears to immolate himself or herself, but the flames are thin and wispy shedding light equal only to half that of a normal torch (15' radius of dim light), and coloured blue or green if variation A is cast, violet or blue if variation B is employed. Any creature striking the spell caster with body or hand-held weapons will inflict normal damage upon the magic-user, but the attacker will take double the amount of damage so inflicted! The other spell powers depend on the variation of the spell used:
A) The flames are hot, and any cold-based attacks will be saved against at +2 on the dice, and either half normal damage or no damage will be sustained, fire-based attacks are normal, but if the magic-user fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he or she will sustain double normal damage. The material component for this variation is a bit of phosphorous.
B) The flames are cold, and any fire-based attack will be saved against at +2 on the dice, and either half normal damage or no damage will be sustained; cold-based attacks are normal, but if the magic-user fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he or she will sustain double normal damage. The material component for this variation is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail portions of 4 dead ones. "|0.4|2+n|VSM|None
4|9|Fire Trap|Any closable item (book, box, bottle. chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth) is affected by a Fire Trap spell, but the item so trapped cannot have a second spell such as Hold Portal or Wizard Lock placed upon it except as follows: if a Fire Trap/Hold Portal is attempted, only the spell first cast will work, and the other will be negated (both negated if cast simultaneously). If a Fire Trap is cast after a Wizard Lock, the former is negated, if both are cast simultaneously both are negated, and if a Wizard Lock is cast after placement of a Fire Trap there is a 50% chance that both spells will be negated. A Knock spell will not affect a Fire Trap in any way - as soon as the offending party enters/touches, the trap will discharge. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it. When the trap is discharged there will be an explosion of 5' radius, and all creatures within this area must make saving throws versus magic. Damage is 1-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per level of the magic-user who cast the spell, or one-half the total amount for creatures successfully saving versus magic. The item trapped is NOT harmed by this explosion. There is only 50% of the normal chance to detect a Fire Trap, and failure to remove it when such action is attempted detonates it immediately. To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a bit of sulphur or saltpetre. |0.3|P|VSM|None
4|10|Fumble|When a Fumble spell is cast, the magic-user causes the recipient of the magic to suddenly become clumsy and awkward. Running creatures will trip and fall, those reaching for an item will fumble and drop it, those employing weapons will likewise awkwardly drop them. Recovery from a fall or of a fumbled object will typically require the whole of the next melee round. Note that breakable items might suffer damage when dropped. If the victim makes his or her saving throw, the Fumble will simply make him or her effectively operate at one-half normal efficiency (cf. slow spell). The material component of this spell is a dab of solidified milk fat. |0.4|n|VSM|Half
4|11|Hallucinatory Terrain|" By means of this spell the magic-user causes an illusion which hides the actual terrain within the area of the spell's effect. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to look as if a swamp or hill or crevasse or same other difficult or impassable terrain existed there. Also, a pond can be made to appear as a grassy meadow, a precipice look as if it were a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to look as if it were a wide and smooth road. The Hallucinatory Terrain persists until a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the area or until it is contacted by an intelligent creature. Each level of experience of the magic-user enables him or her to affect a larger area. At 10th level, a magic-user can affect an area up to 10"" x 10"" square, while at 12th level the spell caster affects a 12"" x 12"" square area. The material components of this spell area stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant - leaf or grass blade. "|10|Special|VSM|None
4|12|Ice Storm|" When this spell is cast, the magic-user causes either great hail stones to pound down in an area of 4"" diameter and inflict from 3 to 30 (3d10) hit points of damage on any creatures within the area of effect; or the Ice Storm can be made to cause driving sleet to fall in an area of 8"" diameter and both blind creatures within its area of effect for the duration of the spell and cause the ground in the area to be icy, thus slowing movement within by 50% and making it 50% probable that a moving creature will slip and fall when trying to move. The material components for this spell are a pinch of dust and a few drops of water. (Note that this spell will negate a Heat Metal spell (q.v.), but its first application will also cause damage in the process.)"|0.4|1|VSM|None
4|13|Massmorph|When this spell is cast upon willing creatures of man-size or smaller, up to 10 such creatures per level of experience of the magic-user can be made to appear as normal trees of any sort. Thus, a company of creatures can be made to appear as a copse, grove, or orchard. Furthermore, these massmorphed creatures can be passed through - and even touched - by other creatures without revealing the Illusion. Note, however, that blows to the creature-trees will reveal their nature, as damage will be sustained by the creatures struck and blood will be seen. Creatures massmorphed must be within the spell's area of effect. Unwilling creatures are not affected. The spell persists until the caster commands it to cease or until a dispel magic is cast upon the creatures. The material component of this spell is a handful of bark chips. |10|Special|VSM|None
4|14|Minor Globe of Invulnerability|This spell creates a magical sphere around the caster which prevents any first, second or third level spells from penetrating, i.e. the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Minor Globe Of Invulnerability. However, any sort of spells can be cast out of the magical sphere, and they pass from the caster of the globe, through its area of effect, and to their target without effect upon the Minor Globe Of Invulnerability. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. It can be brought down by a Dispel Magic spell. The material component of the spell is a glass or crystal bead.|0.4|n|VSM|None
4|15|Monster Summoning II|Within 1-4 rounds of casting this spell, the magic-user will cause the appearance of from 1-6 second level monsters (selected at random by the referee, but whose number may be either randomly determined or selected personally by the referee, according to the strength of the monster randomly determined). These monsters will appear in the spot, within spell range, desired by the magic-user, and they will attack the spell user's opponents to the best of their ability until he or she commands that attack cease, or the spell duration expires, or the monsters ore slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if communication is possible, and if they are physically capable, perform other services for the summoning magic-user. The material components of this spell are a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle. |0.4|3+n|M|None
4|16|Plant Growth|"When a Plant Growth spell is cast by the druid, he or she causes normal vegetation a grow, entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or jungle which creatures must hack or force a way through at a movement rate of 1"" per, or 2"" per with respect to larger than man-sized creatures. Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order to allow this spell to go into effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is 2"" x 2"" square per level of experience of the druid, in any square or rectangular shape that the druid decides upon at the time of the spell casting. Thus an 8th level druid can affect a maximum area of 16"" x 16"" square, a 32"" x 8"" rectangle, a 64"" X 4"" rectangle, 128"" x 2"" rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labour, fire, or such magical means as a Dispel Magic spell (q.v.) "|0.4|P|VS|None
4|17|Polymorph Other|"The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic which completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, creatures with a lower intelligence cannot be polymorphed into something with a higher intelligence, but the reverse is possible. The creature polymorphed must make a ""system shock"" (cf. CONSTITUTION) roll to see if it survives the change. If it is successful, it then acquires all of the form and abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into. There is a base 100% chance that this change will also change its personality and mentality into that of the creature whose form it now possesses. For each 1 point of intelligence of the creature polymorphed, subtract 5% from the base chance. Additionally, for every hit die of difference between the original form and the form it is changed into by the spell, the polymorphed creature must adjust the base chance percentage by +/-5% per hit die below or above its own number (or level in the case of characters). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form must be checked daily until the change takes place. (Note that all creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell) If a one hit die orc of 8 intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 hit dice, for example, it is 85% (100% - [5% x 8 intelligence + [(6 - 1) x ( 5%] = 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it will have the dragon's physical and mental capabilities; and if it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it will know what it formerly knew as well. Another example: an 8th level fighter successfully polymorphed into a blue dragon would know combat with weapons and be able to employ them with prehensile dragon forepaws if the fighter did not take on dragon personality and mentality. However, the new form of the polymorphed creature may be stronger than it looks, i.e. a mummy changed to a puppy dog would be very tough, or a brontosaurus changed to an ant would be impossible to squash merely from being stepped on by a small creature or even a man-sized one. The magic-user must use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this too requires a ""system shock"" saving throw. The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon.  "|0.4|P|VSM|Neg.
4|18|Polymorph Self|"When this spell is cast, the magic-user is able to assume the form of any creature - from as small as a wren to as large as a hippopotamus - and its form of locomotion as well. The spell does not give the other abilities (attack, magic. etc.), nor does it run the risk of changing personality and mentality. No ""system shock"" check is required. Thus, a magic-user changed to an owl could fly, but his or her vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings. but not the pudding's offensive or defensive capabilities. Naturally, the strength of the new form must be sufficient to allow normal movement. The spell caster can change his or her form as often as desired, the change requiring only 5 segments. Damage to the polymorphed form is computed as if it were inflicted upon the magic-user, but when the magic-user returns to his or her own form, from 1 to 12 (d12) points of damage are restored. "|0.3|20n|V|None
4|19|Rary's Mnemonic Enhancer| By means of this spell the magic-user is able to memorize, or retain the memory of, three additional spell levels, i.e. three spells of the first level, or one first and one second, or one third level spell. The magic-user can elect to immediately memorize additional spells or he or she may opt to retain memory of a spell cast by means of the Enhancer. The material components of the spell are a piece of string, an ivory plaque of at least 100 g.p. value, and an ink composed of squid secretion and either black dragon's blood or giant slug digestive juice. All components disappear when the spell is cast.|10|1 day|VSM|None
4|20|Remove Curse|"Upon casting this spell, the cleric is usually able to remove a curse - whether it be on an object, a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the Remove Curse spell will not affect a cursed shield, weapon or suit of armour, for example, although the spell will typically enable the person afflicted with any such cursed item to be rid of it. The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the Bestow Curse lasts for 1 turn for every level of experience of the cleric using the spell. It will lower one ability of the victim to 3 (your DM will determine which by random selection) 50% of the time; reduce the victim's ""to hit"" and saving throw probabilities by -4 25% of the time; or make the victim 50% likely per turn to drop whatever he, she, or it is holding (or simply do nothing in the case of creatures not using tools) 25% of the time. It is possible for a cleric to devise his or her own curse, and it should be similar in power to those shown. Consult your referee. The target of a Bestow Curse spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; and if it is successful, the effect is negated."|0.4|P|VS|Special
4|21|Wall of Fire|"The Wall Of Fire spell brings forth a blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering colour - yellow-green or amber in case of druidical magic. The Wall Of Fire inflicts 4 to 16 hit points of damage, plus 1 hit point of damage per level of the spell caster, upon any creature passing through it. Creatures within 1"" of the wall take 2-12 hit points of damage, those within 2"", take 1-4 hit points of damage. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Only the side of the wall away from the spell caster will inflict damage. The opaque Wall Of Fire lasts for as long as the druid concentrates on maintaining it, or 1 round per level of experience of the druid in the event he or she does not wish to concentrate upon it. The spell creates a sheet of flame up to 2"" square per level of the spell caster, or as a ring with a radius of up to ½"" per level of experience from the druid to its flames, and a height of 2"". The former is stationary, while the latter moves as the druid moves."|0.4|Special|VSM|None
4|22|Wall of Ice|"When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, flexible ice is created. The wall is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is one inch thick per level of experience of the magic-user. It covers a 1"" square area per level, i.e. a 10th level magic-user would cause a Wall Of Ice up to 10"" long and 1"" high, or 5"" long and 2"" high, and so forth. Any creature breaking through the ice will suffer 2 hit points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall, fire-using creatures will suffer 3 hit points, cold-using creatures only 1 hit point when breaking through. If this spell is cast to form a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents, it has the same effect as an Ice Storm's (q.v.) hail stones in the area over which it falls. Magical fires such as Fireballs and fiery dragon breath will melt a Wall Of Ice in 1 round, though they will cause a great cloud of steamy fog which will last 1 turn, but normal fires or lesser magical ones will not hasten its melting. The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.  "|0.4|10n|VSM|None
4|23|Wizard Eye|"When this spell is employed, the magic-user creates an invisible sensory organ which sends visual information to him or her. The Wizard Eye travels at 3"" per round, viewing an area ahead as a human would or 1"" per round examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead and casually viewing the walls ahead. The Wizard Eye can ""see"" with infravision at 10', or it ""sees"" up to 60' distant in brightly lit areas. The Wizard Eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. The material component of the spell is a bit of bat fur."|10|n|VSM|None
5|1|Airy Water| The Airy Water spell turns normal liquid such as water or water based infusions or solutions to a less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if the magic-user were desirous of entering an underwater place, he or she would step into the water, cast the spell and sink downwards in a globe of bubbling water which he or she and any companions in the spell's area of effect could move freely in and breathe just as if it were air rather than water. The globe will move with the spell caster, Note that water breathing creatures will avoid a sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, although intelligent ones can enter it if they are able to move by means other than swimming, but no water-breathers will be able to breathe in an area affected by this spell. There is only one word which needs to be spoken to actuate the magic, and the material component of the spell is a small handful of alkaline or bromine salts.|0.5|10n|VSM|None
5|2|Animal Growth|" When this spell is cast, the druid causes all animals, up to a maximum of 8, within a 2"" square area to grow to twice their normal size. The effects of this growth are doubled hit dice (with resultant improvement in attack potential) and doubled damage in combat. The spell lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the druid casting the spell. Note that the spell is particularly useful in conjunction with a Charm Person or Mammal or a Speak With Animals spell. The reverse reduces animal size by one half, and likewise reduces hit dice, attack damage, etc."|0.3|n|VS|None
5|3|Animate Dead|This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, from the bones or bodies of dead humans. The effect is to cause these remains to become animated and obey the commands of the cleric casting the spell. The skeletons or zombies will follow, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The spell will animate the monsters until they are destroyed or until the magic is dispelled. (See Dispel Magic spell). The cleric is able to animate 1 skeleton or 1 zombie for each level of experience he or she has attained. Thus, a 2nd level cleric can animate 2 of these monsters, a 3rd level 3, etc. The act of animating dead is not basically a good one, and it must be used with careful consideration and good reason by clerics of good alignment. It requires a drop of blood, a piece of human flesh, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. |5|P|VSM|None
5|4|Bigby's Interposing Hand|Bigby's Interposing Hand is a large to huge-sized magic member which appears and places itself between the spell caster and his or her chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then remains between the two, regardless of what the spell caster does subsequently or how the opponent tries to get around it. The size of the Hand is determined by the magic-user, and it can be human-sized all the way up to titan-sized. It takes as many hit points of damage to destroy as the magic-user who cast it. Any creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past it will be slowed to one-half normal movement. The material component of the spell is a glove. |0.5|n|VSM|None
5|5|Cloudkill|"This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly yellowish green vapours which is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 + 1 hit dice, cause creatures with 4 + 1 to 5 + 1 hit dice to save versus poison at -4 on the dice roll, and creatures up to 6 hit dice (inclusive) to save versus poison normally or be slain by the cloud. The Cloudkill moves away from the spell caster at 1"" per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. A wind will cause it to alter course, but it will not move back towards its caster. A strong wind will break it up in 4 rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds, i.e. moving through such vegetation for 2"". As the vapours ore heavier than air, they will sink to the lowest level of the land, even pour down den or sinkhole openings; thus, it is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example.  "|0.5|n|VSM|None
5|6|Cone of Cold|"When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area originating at the magic-user's hand and extending outwards in a cone ½"" long per level of the caster. It drains heat and causes 1 four-sided die, plus 1 hit point of damage (1d4 +1), per level of experience of the magic-user. For example, a 10th level magic-user would cast a Cone Of Cold causing 10d4 + 10 hit points of damage. Its material component is a crystal or glass cone of very small size. "|0.5|I|VSM|Half
5|7|Contact Other Plane|"When this spell is cast, the magic-user sends his or her mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers are located at random, and resent such contact in any case, only brief answers will be given. (Your DM will answer all questions with a ""yes"", ""no"", ""maybe"", ""never"", ""irrelevant"", etc.) The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane further removed. For every 2 levels of experience of the magic-user one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the magic-user increases the probability of the spell caster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes."|10|Special|V|None
5|8|Distance Distortion|This spell can only be cast when the magic-user has an earth elemental conjured up, but the elemental will not react hostilely to co-operation with the spell caster when he or she announces that his or her intent is to cast a Distance Distortion spell. The magic places the earth elemental in the area of effect, and the elemental then causes the area's dimensions to be distorted in either of two ways: 1) the area will effectively be one-half the distance to those travelling over it, or 2) the area will be twice the distance to those travelling across it. Thus a 10' X 100' corridor could seem as if it was but 5' wide and 50' long, or it could appear to be 20' wide and 200' long. When the spell duration has elapsed, the elemental returns to its own plane. The true nature of an area affected by Distance Distortion is absolutely undetectable to any creatures travelling along it, although the area will radiate a dim dweomer, and a True Seeing spell will reveal that an earth elemental is spread within the area. Material needed for this spell is a small lump of soft clay. |0.6|10n|VSM|None
5|9|Feeblemind| spell which is solely for employment against those persons or creatures who use magic spells, Feeblemind causes the victim's brain to become that of a moronic child. The victim remains in this state until a Heal, Restoration or Wish spell is used to do away with the effects. The spell is of such a nature that the probability of it affecting the target creature is generally enhanced, i.e. saving throws are lowered. |0.5|P|VSM|Neg.
5|10|Hold Monster|" This spell immobilizes from one to four creatures of any type within spell range and in sight of the spell caster. He or she can opt to hold one, two, three or four monsters. If three or four are attacked, each saving throw is a normal; if two are attacked, each saving throw is at -1 on the die; and if but one is attacked, the saving throw is at -3 on the die. (Partially-negated Hold Monster spell effects equal those of a Slow spell.) The material component for this spell is one hard metal bar or rod for each monster to be held. The bar or rod can be small, i.e. the size of a three-penny nail. 
 "|0.5|n|VSM|Neg.
5|11|Leomund's Secret Chest|" In order to cast this spell the magic-user must have an exceptionally well-crafted and expensive chest constructed for him by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it must be of ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be of platinum. If constructed of ivory. the metal fittings of the chest may be of gold; and if the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings may be of electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest will never be less than 5,000 g.p. Once constructed, the magic-user must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One magic-user can have but one pair of these chests at any given time, and even wish spells will not allow exceptions.
While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This will cause the large chest to vanish into the ethereal plane. The chest can contain one cubic foot of material per level of the magic-user no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell will fail, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magic items, gems, etc. As long as the spell caster has the small duplicate of the magic chest, he or she can recall the large one from the ethereal plane to the locale he or she is in when the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, including a wish, that the large chest will return.
While on the ethereal plane, there is a 1% cumulative chance per week that some creature/being will find the chest. If this occurs there is 10% likelihood that the chest will be ignored, 10% possibility that something will be added to the contents, 30% possibility that the contents will be exchanged for something else, 30% chance that something will be stolen from it, and 20% probability that it will be emptied. In addition, when the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened and remains open for 5 hours, slowly diminishing in size. As this hole opens between the planes there is a 5% chance that some ethereal monster will be drawn through, with a 1% cumulative reduction in probability each hour thereafter until the window is gone. However, no creature on the Prime Material Plane can locate the chest even with a gem of seeing, true seeing, etc.
If Leomund's Secret Chest is not retrieved before spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest will be lost forever, i.e. 5% chance for loss at 61 days, 10% at 62 days, and so forth. "|10|60 days|VSM|None
5|12|Monster Summoning III|Within 1-4 rounds of casting this spell, the magic-user will cause the appearance of from 1-4 third level monsters (selected at random by the referee, but whose number may be either randomly determined or selected personally by the referee, according to the strength of the monster randomly determined). These monsters will appear in the spot, within spell range, desired by the magic-user, and they will attack the spell user's opponents to the best of their ability until he or she commands that attack cease, or the spell duration expires, or the monsters ore slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if communication is possible, and if they are physically capable, perform other services for the summoning magic-user. The material components of this spell are a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle.|0.5|40+10n|VSM|None
5|13|Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound|" By means of this spell the magic-user summons up a phantom watchdog which only he or she can see, He or she may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog will immediately commence a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the Faithful Hound is able to detect invisible, astral, ethereal, out of phase, duo-dimensional, or similarly non-visible creatures, it is an excellent guardian. In addition, if the intruding creature or creatures allow their backs to be exposed to the phantom watchdog, it will deliver a vicious attack as if it were a 10 hit dice monster, striking for 3-18 hit points of damage, and being able to hit opponents of all sorts, even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. The Faithful Hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. Note, however, that the spell caster can never be more than 3"" distant from the area that the phantom watchdog is guarding, or the magic is automatically dispelled. The material components of this spell are a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread. "|0.5|2n|VSM|None
5|14|Passwall|A Passwall enables the spell caster to open a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls; thus he or she and any associates can simply walk through. The spell causes a 5' wide by 8' high by 10' deep opening. Note several of these spells will form a continuing passage so that very thick walls can be pierced. The material component a this spell is a pinch of sesame seeds.|0.5|60+10n|VSM|None
5|15|Stone Shape| By means of this spell the magic-user can form an existing piece of stone into a shape which will suit his or her purposes. For example, a stone weapon can be made, a special trapdoor fashioned, or an idol sculpted. By the same token, it would allow the spell caster to reshape a stone door, perhaps, so as to escape imprisonment providing the volume of stone involved was within the limits of the area of effect. While stone coffers can be thus formed, secret doors made, etc., the fineness of detail is not great. The material component of this spell is soft clay which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone when the spell is uttered. |1|P|VSM|None
5|16|Telekinesis|"By means of this spell the magic-user is able to move objects by will force, by concentrating on moving them mentally. The Telekinesis spell causes the desired object to move vertically or horizontally. Movement is 2"" the first round, 4"" the second, 8"" the third, 16"" the fourth, and so on, doubling each round until a maximum telekinetic movement of 1,024"" per round is reached. (Heavy objects travelling at high speed can be deadly weapons!) Note that Telekinesis can be used to move opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell, but if they are able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an Enlarge spell, for example (thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell limit), it is easily countered. Likewise, ambulation or some other form of motive power if the recipient of the spell is not able to ambulate, counters the effect of Telekinesis, provided the velocity has not reached 16"" per round. The various Bigby's Hand spells will also counter this spell, as will many other magics."|0.5|2+n`|VS|None
5|17|Teleport|When this spell is used, the magic-user instantly transports himself or herself, along with a certain amount of additional weight which is upon, or being touched by, the spell caster, to a well-known destination. Distance is not a factor, but inter-plane travel is not possible by means of a Teleport spell. The spell caster is able to Teleport a maximum weight of 2,500 g.p. equivalence, plus an additional 1,500 g.p. weight for each level of experience above the 10th, i.e. a 13th level magic-user teleports a maximum weight of 7,000 g.p. (700 pounds). If the destination area is very familiar to the magic-user (he or she has a clear mental picture through actual proximity to and studying of the area) it is unlikely that there will be any error in arriving exactly in the place desired. Lesser known areas (those seen only magically or from a distance) increase the probability of error. Unfamiliar areas present considerable peril.|0.2|I|V|None
5|18|Transmute Rock to Mud|"This spell turns natural rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. The depth of the mud can never exceed one-half its length and/or breadth. If it is cast upon a rock, for example, the rock affected will collapse into mud. Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud will sink and suffocate, save for lightweight creatures which could normally pass across such ground. The mud will remain until a dispel magic spell or a reverse of this spell, Mud To Rock, restores its substance - but not necessarily its form. Evaporation will turn the mud to normal dirt, from 1 to 6 days per cubic 1"" being required. The exact time depends on exposure to sun, wind and normal drainage. The Mud To Rock reverse will harden normal mud into soft stone (sandstone or similar mineral) permanently unless magically changed."|0.5|Special|VSM|None
5|19|Wall of Force|A Wall Of Force spell creates an invisible barrier in the locale desired by the caster, up to the spell's range. The Wall Of Force will not move and is totally unaffected by any other spells, including Dispel Magic, save a Disintegrate spell, which will immediately destroy it. Likewise, the Wall Of Force is not affected by blows, missiles, cold, heat electricity, or any similar things. Spells or breath weapons will not pass through it in either direction. The magic-user can, if desired, shape the wall to a hemispherical or spherical shape with an area equal to his or her ability, maximum of 20 square feet per level of experience. The material component for this spell is a pinch of powdered diamond. |0.5|10+n|VSM|None
5|20|Wall of Iron|When this spell is cast, the magic-user causes a vertical iron wall to spring into being. Typically, this wall is used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding material if its area is sufficient to do so. The Wall Of Iron is one quarter of an inch thick per level of experience of the spell caster. The magic-user is able to evoke an area of iron wall 15 square feet for each of his or her experience levels, so at 12th level a Wall Of Iron 180 square feet in area can be created. If the wall is created in a location where it is not supported, it will fall and crush any creature beneath it. The wall is permanent, unless attacked by a Dispel Magic spell, but subject to all forces a normal iron wall is subject to. i.e. rust, perforation, etc. The material component of this spell is a small piece of sheet iron.  |0.5|P|VSM|None
5|21|Wall of Stone|This spell creates a wall of granite rock which merges into adjoining rock surfaces if the area is sufficient to allow it. It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents. The wall of stone is ¼' thick and 20' square in area per level of experience of the magic-user casting the spell. Thus, a 12th level magic-user creates a wall of stone 3' thick and 240 square feet in surface area (a 12' wide and 20' high wall, for example, to completely close a 10' x 16' passage). The wall created need not be vertical nor rest upon any firm foundation (cf. wall of iron); however, it must merge with an existing stone formation. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. The wall is permanent unless destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell or by normal means such as breaking, chipping or a Disintegrate spell The material component is a small block of granite. |0.5|P|VSM|None
6|1|Anti-Magic Shell| By means of an Anti-Magic Shell, the magic-user causes an invisible barrier to surround his or her person. and this moves with the spell caster. This barrier is totally impervious to all magic and magic spell effects (this includes such attack forms as breath weapons, gaze weapons, and voice weapons). It thus prevents the entrance of spells or their effects, and it likewise prevents the function of any magical items or spells within its confines. It prevents the entrance of charmed, summoned, and conjured creatures. However, normal creatures (assume a normal troll rather than one conjured up, for instance) can pass through the shell, as can normal missiles. While a magic sword would not function magically within the shell, it would still be a sword.|0.1|1|VS|None
6|2|Bigby's Forceful Hand|"Bigby's Forceful Hand is a more powerful version of Bigby's Interposing Hand (q.v.). It exerts a force in addition to interposing itself, and this force is sufficient to push a creature away from the spell caster if the creature weighs 500 pounds or less, to push so as to slow movement to 1"" per round if the creature weighs between 500 and 2,000 pounds, and to slow movement by 50% of creatures weighing up to 8,000 pounds. It takes as many hit points to destroy as its creator has. Its material component is a glove. "|0.6|n|VSM|None
6|3|Control Weather| The Control Weather spell allows a cleric to change the weather in the area he or she is in at the time the spell is cast. The spell will affect the weather for from 4 to 48 hours (4d12) in an area of from 4 to 16 square miles (4d4). It requires 1 turn to cast the spell, and an additional 1 to 4 (d4) turns for the effects of the weather to be felt. The Control Weather spell will not radically change the temperature, i.e. from below zero to a 100 degree temperature heat wave. |10|4d6 hours|VSM|None
6|4|Death Spell|When a Death Spell is cast, it slays creatures in the area of effect instantly and irrevocably. The number of creatures which can be so slain is a function of their hit dice: |0.6|I|VSM|None
6|5|Disintegrate|" This spell causes matter to vanish. It will affect even matter (or energy) of a magical nature, such as Bigby's Forceful Hand, but not a Globe Of Invulnerability or an Anti-Magic Shell. Disintegration is instantaneous, and its effects are permanent. Any living thing can be affected, even undead, and non-living matter up to 1"" cubic volume can be obliterated by the spell. Creatures, and magical material with a saving throw, which successfully save versus the spell are not affected. Only 1 creature or object can be the target of the spell. Its material components are a lodestone and o pinch of dust. "|0.6|P|VSM|Neg.
6|6|Enchant an Item|" This is a spell which must be used by a magic-user planning to create a magic item. The Enchant An Item spell prepares the object to accept the magic to be placed upon or within it. The item to be magicked must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e. crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw materials cost in excess of 100 g.p. With respect to requirement 3), it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, and/or engraved; however, if such work or materials can be added to on item without weakening or harming its normal functions, these are required for the item to be magicked.
The item to be prepared must be touched manually by the spell caster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8-64 hours (as the magic-user may never work over 8 hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter time required in any way, this effectively means that Casting Time for this spell is 2 days + 1-8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1' distant from the spell caster, for if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic may be performed, and the magic-user must remain quiet and in isolation.) At the end of the spell, the caster will ""know"" that the item is ready for the final test. He or she will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the magic-user who magicked it) versus magic, the spell is completed. (Note that the spell caster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to but not exceeding +3.) A result of 1 on the die (d20) always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the magic-user may begin to place the desired dweomer upon the item, and the spell he or she plans to place on or within the item must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must again be enchanted.
Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 4 hours + 4-8 additional hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the magic-user, and during rest periods it must always be within 1' of his or her person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive dweomer must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if any prior spell failed.
No magic placed on or into an item is permanent unless a Permanency spell is used as a finishing touch, and this always runs a risk of draining a point of constitution from the magic-user casting the spell. It is also necessary to point out that while it is possible to tell when the basic (Enchant An Item) spell succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually take, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, items that are charged - rods, staves, wands, javelins of lightning, ring of wishes, etc. - can never be made permanent. Scrolls or magic devices can never be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared.
The material component(s) for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being magicked and successive magicks to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of 1 or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are known by your Dungeon Master. "|Special|Special|VSM|Neg.
6|7|Geas| A Geas spell places a magical command upon the creature (usually human or humanoid) to carry out some service, or refrain from same action or course of activity, as desired by the spell caster. The creature must be intelligent, conscious, and under its own volition. While a Geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself, or to perform acts which are likely to result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of action. The spell causes the geased creature to follow the instructions until the Geas is completed. Failure to do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1 to 4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of the instructions causes corresponding loss of strength points until the deviation ceases. A Geas can be done away with by a Wish spell, but a Dispel Magic or Remove Curse will not negate it. Your referee will instruct you as to any additional details of a geas, for its casting and fulfilment are tricky. and an improperly cast Geas is null and void immediately (cf. Wish). |0.4|Special|V|None
6|8|Glassee|By means of this spell the magic-user is able to make a section of metal, stone or wood as transparent as glass to his gaze, or even make it into transparent material as explained hereafter. Normally, up to four inches of metal can be seen through, stone up to 6' thick can be made transparent, and 20' of wood can be affected by the Glassee spell. The spell will not work on lead, gold or platinum. The magic-user can opt to make the Glassee apply to himself or herself only, and apply it up to once per round while spell duration lasts; or the caster can actually make a transparent area, a one-way window, in the material affected. Either case gives a viewing area 3' wide by 2' high. The material component of the spell is a small piece of crystal or glass. |1|n|VSM|None
6|9|Globe of Invulnerability|"This spell is the same as the fourth level Minor Globe Of Invulnerability (q.v.), except as regards casting time and for the fact that it prevents the functioning of first through fourth level spell, affecting the magic-user within the globe, while he or she can cast spells through it, of course.
 "|1|n|VSM|None
6|10|Guards and Wards|" This special and powerful spell is primarily used to defend the magic-user's stronghold. The following take place in the area of effect upon casting of the spell:
1. All corridors become misty, and visibility is reduced to 10'.
2. All doors are Wizard Locked.
3. One door per level of experience of the magic-user is covered by an illusion as if it were a plain wall.
4. Stairs are filled with webs from top to bottom.
5. Where there are choices of direction - such as a cross or side passage - a minor confusion-type spell functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders will believe they are going in the exact opposite direction.
6. The whole area radiates magic.
7. The magic-user can place one of the following additional magics:
    A. Dancing Lights in four corridors, or
    B. Magic Mouths in two places, or
    C. Stinking Clouds in two places, or
    D. Gust Of Wind in one corridor or room, or
    E. Suggestion in one place.
Note that items 3 and 7 function only when the magic-user is totally familiar with the area of the spell's effect. Dispel Magic can remove one effect, at random, per casting of a dispel. A Remove Curse will not work. The material components of the spell are burning incense, a small measure of sulphur and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod. "|30|n hours|VSM|None
6|11|Invisible Stalker|This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8 hit die monster will obey and serve the spell caster in performance at whatever tasks are set before it. However, the creature is bound to serve; it does not do so from loyalty or desire. Therefore, ii will resent prolonged missions or complex tasks, and it will attempt to pervert instructions accordingly (for complete details of the invisible stalker, consult ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL). The invisible stalker will follow instructions even at hundreds or thousands of miles distance. The material components of this spell are burning incense and a piece of horn carved into a crescent shape. |1|Special|VSM|None
6|12|Legend Lore|The Legend Lore spell is used to determine information available regarding a known person. place or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if the magic-user is in the place in question, the likelihood of the spell producing results is far greater and the casting time is only 1 to 4 turns. If detailed information on the person, place or thing is known, casting time is 1 to 10 days. If only rumours are known, casting time is 2 to 12 weeks. During the casting, the magic-user cannot engage in other activities other than routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination will reveal if legendary material is available. It will often reveal where this material is - by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It will sometimes give certain information regarding the person, place or thing (when the object of the Legend Lore is at hand), but this data will always be in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). The spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item must be sacrificed in addition - a potion, magic scroll, magic item, creature, etc. Naturally, Legend Lore will reveal information only if the person, place or thing is noteworthy or legendary. |Special|Special|VSM|None
6|13|Lower Water|" The wizrd casting a lower water spell causes water or similar fluid in the area of effect to sink away. Lowering is 5% of original effect for every level of experience of the wizard, i.e. 40% at 8th level, 45% at 9th, 50% at 10th, etc. The effect of the spell lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric casting it. Likewise, the area of effect increases by level of experience, an 8th level wizard affecting an area of 8"" x 8"", a 9th level an area of 9"" x 9"", and so forth. The reverse of the spell causes the water or similar fluid to return to its normal highest level, plus one foot for every level of experience of the wizard casting it. "|10|5n|VSM|None
6|14|Monster Summoning IV|Within 1-4 rounds of casting this spell, the magic-user will cause the appearance of from 2-8 first level monsters (selected at random by the referee, but whose number may be either randomly determined or selected personally by the referee, according to the strength of the monster randomly determined). These monsters will appear in the spot, within spell range, desired by the magic-user, and they will attack the spell user's opponents to the best of their ability until he or she commands that attack cease, or the spell duration expires, or the monsters ore slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if communication is possible, and if they are physically capable, perform other services for the summoning magic-user. The material components of this spell are a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle. |0.6|5+n|VSM|None
6|15|Move Earth|"When cast the Move Earth spell moves dirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other components. Thus, embankments can be collapsed, hillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. The area to be affected will dictate the casting time; for every 4"" square area, 1 turn of casting time is required. If terrain features are to be moved - as compared to simply caving in banks or walls of earth - it is necessary that an earth elemental be subsequently summoned to assist. All spell casting and/or summoning must be completed before any effects occur. In no event can rock prominences be collapsed or moved. The material components for this spell are a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade. "|Special|P|VSM|None
6|16|Otiluke's Freezing Sphere|"Otiluke's Freezing Sphere is a multi-purpose dweomer of considerable power. If the caster opts, he or she may create a globe of matter at absolute zero temperature which spreads upon contact with water or liquid which is principally composed of water, so as to freeze it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the magic-user casting the spell. The ice so formed lasts for 1 round per level of the caster. The spell can also be used as a thin ray of cold which springs from the caster's hand to a distance of 1"" per level of the magic-user; this ray will inflict 4 hit points of damage per level of the caster upon the creature struck, with a saving throw versus magic applicable, and all damage negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed), but the path of the ray being plotted to its full distance, as anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or take appropriate damage. Finally, Otiluke's Freezing Sphere can be cast so as to create a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be cast, and it will shatter upon impact, inflicting 4-24 hit points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10' radius (one-half damage if saving throw versus magic is made). Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within a time period equal to 1 round times the level of the spell caster, it automatically shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can also prove hazardous to the spell caster and/or his or her associates as well. The material components of the spell depend upon in which form it is to be cast. A thin sheet of crystal about an inch square is needed for the first application of the spell, a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 g.p. value for the second application of the spell, and a 1,000 g.p. diamond is minimum for the third application of the spell. All components are lost when the spell is cast"|0.6|Special|VSM|Special
6|17|Part Water|"By employing a Part Water spell, the cleric is able to cause water or similar liquid to move apart. thus forming a trough. The depth and length of the trough created by the spell is dependent upon the level of the cleric, and a trough 3' deep by 1' by 1"" (10' or 10 yards) is created per level, i.e. at 12th level the cleric would part water 36' deep by 12' wide by 24"" (240' or 240 yards) long. The trough will remain as long as the spell lasts or until the cleric who cast it opts to end its effects (cf. Dispel Magic). The material component of this spell is the cleric's religious symbol."|10|5n|VSM|None
6|18|Project Image|By means of this spell, the magic-user creates a non-material duplicate of himself or herself, projecting it to any spot within spell range which is desired. This image performs actions identical to the magic-user - walking, speaking, spell-casting - as the magic-user determines. A special channel exists between the image of the magic-user and the actual magic-user, so spells cast actually originate from the image. The image can be dispelled only by means of a Dispel Magic spell (or upon command from the spell caster), and attacks do not affect it. The image must be within view of the magic-user projecting it at all times, and if his or her sight is obstructed, the spell is broken. The material component of this spell is a small replica (doll) of the magic-user. |0.6|n|VSM|None
6|19|Reincarnation|This spell is similar to the seventh level druid spell of the same name (q.v.). It does not require any saving throw for system shock or resurrection survival. The corpse is touched, and a new incarnation of the person will appear in the area in 1 to 6 turns, providing the person has not been dead for longer than 1 day per level of experience of the magic-user. |10|P|VSM|None
6|20|Repulsion|"When this spell is cast, the magic-user is able to cause all creatures in the path of the area of effect to move away from his or her person. Repulsion is at 3"" per round, or at the motive speed of the creature attempting to move towards the spell caster. The repelled creature will continue to move away for the balance of a complete move even though this takes it beyond spell range. The material component of this spell is a pair of small magnetized iron bars attached to two small canine statuettes, one ivory and one ebony. "|0.6|0.5n|VSM|None
6|21|Spiritwrack|" A Spiritwrack spell is a very strong protection/punishment spell against the powerful creatures of the nether planes (Abyssal, Hades, Hell, etc.), but to employ the magic, the spell caster must know the name of the being at whom he or she will direct the energy. Prior to actual utterance of a Spiritwrack spell the magic-user must prepare an illuminated sheet of vellum, carefully inscribed in special inks made from powdered rubies and the ichor of a slain demon of type I, II, or III and covered with gold leaf in a continuous border. The spell caster must personally prepare this document, including the being's name thereon. (This will require from 8-32 hours of time and cost 1,000 g.p. for vellum, special pens, gold leaf, and other miscellaneous materials alone; the cost of the powdered rubies is a minimum of 5,000 g.p. for each document.) If the demon, devil, or other powerful being from a nether outer plane is present in some form (and not possessing another creature's body instead), the magic-user can then begin actual spell incantation.
Immediately upon beginning the reading of the document, the being named will be rooted to the spot unless it makes its magic resistance percentage (adjusted for the level of the magic-user) as a saving throw; and even if such a saving throw is made, the monster feels greatly uncomfortable, and if it has not been magically forced to the locale and so held there, it is 90% likely to retreat to its own (or another) plane, as the named being is powerless to attack the magic-user while he or she is reading the spell document. This first part of the document continues for 1 full round, with the discomfort to the named being becoming greater at the end. During the second minute of the incantation, the being named undergoes acute pain and loses 1 hit point per hit die it possesses. At the end of this round of reading, the being is in wracking pain. The third and final round of utterance of the condemnation will cause a loss to the being of 50% of its existing hit points, horrible pain, and at the end consign it to some confined space on its own plane - there to remain in torture for a number of years equal to the level of the magic-user who prepared the document.
Obviously, the being so dealt with will be the sworn foe of the magic-user forever afterwards, so the magic-user will be loath to finish the spell but rather use it as a threat to force submission of the being. Each round of reading will cause the being forced to listen to be a cumulative 25% likely to concede even without any other offerings or payment."|Special|Special|VM|Special
6|22|Stone to Flesh| The Stone To Flesh spell turns any sort of stone into flesh - if the recipient stone object was formerly living, it will restore life (and goods), although the survival of the creature is subject to the usual system shock survival dice roll. Any formerly living creature, regardless of size, can be thus returned to flesh. Ordinary stone can be likewise turned to flesh at a volume of 9 cubic feet per level of experience of the spell caster. The reverse will turn flesh of any sort to stone, just as the Stone To Flesh spell functions. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. This reverse of the spell will require a saving throw be allowed the intended victim. The material components of the spell are a pinch of earth and a drop of blood; lime and water and earth are used for the reverse. |0.6|P|VSM|Special
6|23|Tenser's Transformation| Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the magic-user casts the dweomer, he or she undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the magic-user increase to heroic proportions, so he or she becomes a formidable fighting machine, for the spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter. The magic-user's hit points double, and all damage he or she sustains comes first from the magical points gained; so if damage does not exceed original hit points, none is actually taken, but if damage beyond the additional amount is sustained. each point counts as 2 (double damage). The armour class of the magic-user is a full 4 factors better than that he or she possessed prior to casting the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9 to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), all attacks are at a level equal to those of a fighter of the same level as the magic-user (i.e., the spell caster uses the combat table normally restricted to fighters), and although he or she can employ a dagger only in attacking, damage inflicted by the weapon is at +2 additional hit points, and 2 such attacks per round are made by the magic-user. However, it is worth noting that this spell must run its full course, and the magic-user will continue attacking until all opponents are slain, he or she is killed, the magic is dispelled, or the Transformation duration expires. The material component for casting this dweomer is a potion of heroism (or superheroism) which the magic-user must consume during the course of uttering the spell. |0.6|n|VSM|None
7|1|Bigby's Grasping Hand|Bigby's Grasping Hand is a superior version of the sixth level Bigby's Forceful Hand spell (q.v.), being like it in many ways. The Grasping Hand can actually hold motionless a creature or object of up to 1,000 pounds weight, or move creatures as a double strength Forceful Hand. The material component is a leather glove. |0.7|n|VSM|None
7|2|Cacodemon|"This perilous exercise in dweomercraeft summons up a powerful demon of type V, V, or VI, depending upon the demon's name being known to the magic-user. Note that this spell is not of sufficient power to bring a demon of greater power, and lesser sorts are not called as they have no known names. In any event, the spell caster must know the name of the type IV, V, or VI demon he or she is summoning. As the spell name implies, the demon so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed. The spell caster must be within a circle of protection (or a thaumaturgic triangle with Protection From Evil) and the demon confined within a pentagram (circled pentacle) if he or she is to avoid being slain or carried off by the summoned cacodemon. The summoned demon can be treated with as follows:
1) The magic-user can require the monster to perform a desired course of action by force of threat and pain of a Spiritwrack spell (q.v.), allowing freedom whenever the demon performs the full extent of the service, and forcing the demon to pledge word upon it. This is exceedingly dangerous, as a minor error in such a bargain will be seized upon by the monster to reverse the desired outcome or simply to kill and devour the summoner. Furthermore, the demon will bear great enmity for the magic-user forever after such forced obedience, so the spell caster had better be most powerful and capable.
2) By tribute of fresh human blood and the promise of 1 or more human sacrifices, the summoner can bargain with the demon for willing service. Again, the spell caster is well advised to have ample protection and power to defend himself or herself, as the demon might decide the offer is insufficient - or it is easier to enjoy the summoner's slow death - and decide not to accept the bargain as offered. Although the demon will have to abide by a pledge, as his name is known, he will have to hold only to the exact word of the arrangement, not to the spirit of the agreement. On the other hand, only highly evil magic-users are likely to attempt to strike such a bargain, and the summoned cacodemon might be favourably disposed towards such a character, especially if he or she is also chaotic.
3) The summoned demon can be the object of a Trap The Soul spell (q.v.). In this case, the magic-user will not speak with or bargain for the demon's services, although the cacodemon might be eager to reach an accord with the dweomercraefter before he is forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the demon is risky only if proper precautions have not been taken, for failure to confine the monster usually means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped, the demon must remain imprisoned until the possessor of his object of confinement breaks it and frees him, and this requires one service from the now loosed monster. If the individual(s) freeing the demon fails to demand a service when the monster asks what is required of him, the demon is under no constraint not to slay the liberator(s) on the spot, but if a service is required, the creature must first do his best to perform it and then return to the Abyss.
The duration of service of any demon must be limited unless the demon is willing to serve for an extended period. Any required course of action or service which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to perform, or is impossible to perform, is 50% likely to free the demon from his obligations and enable him to be unconstrained in his vengeance upon the spell caster if he or she is not thereafter continually protected, for a demon so freed can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days.
The demon summoned will be exceptionally strong, i.e. 8 hit points per hit die.
Casting time is 1 hour per type (numeric) of the demon to be summoned. If there is any interruption during this period, the spell fails. If there is an interruption while the cacodemon is summoned, it is 10% probable that it will be able to escape its boundaries and attack the magic-user, this percentage rising cumulatively each round of continued interruption.
Each demon is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell. If a score higher than the level of the magic-user summoning is rolled with 3d6 (2d6 with respect to type VI demons), that particular spell failed to bring the desired demon. When this occurs, it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct, so the spell caster will have to call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon.
The components of this spell ore 5 flaming black candles; a brazier of hot coals upon which must be burned sulphur, bat hairs, lard, soot, mercuric-nitric acid crystals, mandrake root, alcohol, and a piece of parchment with the demon's name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish of blood from some mammal (preferably a human, of course) placed inside the area where the cacodemon is to be held."|Special|Special|VSM|Special
7|3|Charm Plants|"The Charm Plants spell allows the spell caster to bring under command vegetable life forms, communicate with them, and these plants will obey instructions to the best of their ability. The spell will charm plants in a 3"" x 1"" area. While the spell does not endow the vegetation with new abilities, it does allow the magic-user to command the plants to use whatever they have in order to fulfil his or her instructions, and if the plants in the area of effect do have special or unusual abilities, these will be used as commanded by the magic-user. The saving throw applies only to intelligent plants, and it is made at -4 on the die roll. The material components of the spell area pinch of humus, a drop of water and a twig or leaf. "|10|P|VSM|Neg.
7|4|Delayed-Blast Fireball|This spell creates a fire ball with +1 on each of its dice of damage, and it will not release its blast for from 1 to 50 segments (1/10 to 5 rounds), according to the command upon casting by the magic-user. It activates as an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar, and delivers damage proportionate to the level of the magic-user who cast it, i.e. 1 six-sided die (d6) for each level of experience of the spell caster. Exception: magic Fireball wands deliver 6 die fireballs (6d6), magic staves with this capability deliver 8 die Fireballs, and scroll spells of this type deliver a Fireball of from 5 to 10 dice (d6 + 4) of damage. The burst of the Fireball does not expend a considerable amount of pressure, and the burst will generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume. [The area which is covered by the Fireball is a total volume of roughly 33,000 cubic feet (or yards)]. Besides causing damage to creatures, the Fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the Fireball will melt soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Items exposed to the spell's effects must be rolled for to determine if they are affected. Items with a creature which makes its saving throw are considered as unaffected. The magic-user points his or her finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body prior to attaining the prescribed range, flowers into the Fireball. If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point damage from the blast. Those who make saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat or roll aside, taking ½ the full hit point damage - each and every one within the blast area. The material component of this spell is a tiny ball composed of bat guano and sulphur. |0.7|Special|VS|Half
7|5|Drawmij's Instant Summons| When this spell is cast, the magic-user teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to his or her hand. The object must be singular, can be no larger than a sword is long, have no more mass and weight than a shield (about 75 g.p. weight), and it must be non-living. To prepare this spell, the magic-user must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 g.p. value in his or her hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. He or she then must have this same gem available to cast the spell. All that is then required is that the magic-user utter the final word while crushing the gem, and the desired item is transported instantly into the spell caster's right or left hand as he or she desires. The item must, of course, have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named, and only that particular item will be summoned by the spell. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell will not work, but the caster will know who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the magic-user is able to summon a desired item from 1 plane further removed from the plane he or she is upon at the time the spell is cast, i.e. 1 plane at 14th level, but 2 at 15th, 3 at 16th. etc. Thus, a magic-user of 16th level could effect the spell even if the item desired was on the second layer of one of the outer planes, but at 14th level the magic-user would be able to summon the item only if it were on one of the Elemental Planes or the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. |0.1|I|VS|Half
7|6|Duo-Dimension|"A Duo-Dimension spell causes the caster to have only two dimensions, height and width but no depth. He or she is thus invisible when a sideways turn is made, and this invisibility can only be detected by means of a true seeing spell or similar means. In addition, the duo-dimensional magic-user can pass through the thinnest of spaces as long as they have the proper height according to his or her actual length - going through the space between a door and its frame is a simple matter. The magic-user can perform all actions on a normal basis. He or she can turn and become invisible, move in this state, and appear again next round and cast a spell, disappearing on the following round. Note that when turned the magic-user cannot be affected by any form of attack, but when visible he or she is subject to triple the amount of damage normal for an attack form, i.e. a dagger thrust would inflict 3-12 hit points of damage if it struck a duo-dimensional magic-user. Furthermore, the magic-user has a portion of his or her existence on the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect, and he or she is subject to possible notice from creatures thereupon. If noticed, it is 25% probable that the magic-user will be entirety brought to the Astral Plane by attack from the astral creature.
The material components of this spell are a thin, flat ivory likeness of the spell caster (which must be of finest workmanship, gold filigreed, and enamelled and gem-studded at an average cost of 5,000 to 10,000 g.p.) and a strip of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the parchment is given a half twist and joined at the ends. The figurine is then passed through the parchment loop, and both disappear forever. "|0.7|3+n|VSM|None
7|7|Limited Wish|A Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfil literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spell caster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present or future might be altered (but possibly only for the magic-user unless the warding of the Limited Wish is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities, nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points (or all hit points for a limited duration) lost by the magic-user. It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage, it can increase duration of some magical effect, it can cause a creature to be favourably disposed to the spell caster, and so on (cf. Wish). The Limited Wish can possibly give a minor clue to some treasure or magic item. Greedy desires will usually end in disaster for the wisher. Casting time is the actual number of seconds - at six per segment - to phrase the Limited Wish.  |Special|Special|V|Special
7|8|Mass Invisibility|This spell causes many recipients to vanish from sight and not be detectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creatures are not magically silenced with respect to noises normal to it. The spell remains In effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, or any recipient cancels it or until he, she or it attacks any creature. Thus, a recipient could open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if any form of attack is made, the invisible creature immediately becomes visible, although this will allow the first attack by the creature because of the former invisibility. Even the allies of the spell recipient cannot see the invisible creature, or his, her or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Note that all highly intelligent creatures with 10 or more hit dice, or levels of experience, or the equivalent in intelligence/dice/levels have a chance to automatically detect invisible objects. The material components of the Invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter. |0.7|Special|VSM|None
7|9|Monster Summoning V|Within 1-4 rounds of casting this spell, the magic-user will cause the appearance of from 1-2 fifth level monsters (selected at random by the referee, but whose number may be either randomly determined or selected personally by the referee, according to the strength of the monster randomly determined). These monsters will appear in the spot, within spell range, desired by the magic-user, and they will attack the spell user's opponents to the best of their ability until he or she commands that attack cease, or the spell duration expires, or the monsters ore slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if communication is possible, and if they are physically capable, perform other services for the summoning magic-user. The material components of this spell are a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle. |0.6|6+n|VSM|None
7|10|Mordenkainen's Sword|"Upon casting this spell, the magic-user brings into being a shimmering sword-like plane of force. The spell caster is able to mentally wield this weapon (to the exclusion of activities other than movement), causing it to move and strike as if it were being used by a fighter. The basic chance for Mordenkainen's Sword to hit is the same as the chance for a sword wielded by a fighter of one-half the level of the spell caster, i.e. if cast by a 12th level magic-user, the weapon has the same hit probability as a sword wielded by a 6th level fighter. The sword has no magical ""to hit"" bonuses, but it can hit any sort of opponent even those normally struck only by +3 weapons or astral, ethereal or out of phase; and it will hit any armour class on a roll of 19 or 20. It inflicts 5-20 hit points on opponents of man-size or smaller, and 5-30 on opponents larger than man-sized. It can be used to subdue. It lasts until the spell duration expires, a dispel magic is used successfully upon it, or its caster no longer desires it. The material component is a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc which costs 500 g.p. to construct, and which disappears after the spell's completion. "|0.7|n|VSM|None
7|11|Phase Door|"When this spell is cast, the magic-user attunes he or her body, and a section of wall is affected as if by a Passwall spell (q.v.). The Phase Door is invisible to all creatures save the spell caster, and only he or she can use the space or passage the spell creates, disappearing when the Phase Door is entered, and appearing when it is exited. The Phase Door lasts for 1 usage for every 2 levels of experience of the spell caster. It can be dispelled only by a casting of Dispel Magic from a higher level magic-user, or by several lower level magic-users, casting in concert, whose combined levels of experience are more than double that of the magic-user who cast the spell.
 "|0.7|Special|V|None
7|12|Power Word: Stun|"When a Power Word, Stun is uttered, any creature of the magic-user's choice will be stunned - reeling and unable to think cogently or act for 2 to 8 (2d4) melee rounds. Of course, the magic-user must be facing the creature, and it must be within the spell caster's range or ½"" per level of experience. Creatures with 1 to 30 hit points will be stunned for 4-16 (4d4) rounds, those with 31 to 60 hit points will be stunned for 2 to (2d4) rounds, those with 61 to 90 hit points will be stunned for 1 to 4 (d4) rounds, and creatures with over 90 hit points will not be affected. Note that if a creature is weakened due to any cause so that its hit points are below the usual maximum, the current number of hit points possessed will be used."|0.1|Special|V|None
7|13|Reverse Gravity|"This spell reverses gravity in the area of effect, causing all unfixed objects and creatures within it to ""fall"" upwards. The Reverse Gavity lasts for 1 second (1/6 segment) during which time the objects and creatures will ""fall"" 16' up. If some solid object is encountered in this ""fall"", the object strikes it in the some manner as a normal downward fall. At the end of the spell duration, the affected objects and creatures fall downwards. As the spell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds or even thousands of feet in the air can be affected. The material components of this spell are a lodestone and iron filings."|0.7|0.1|VSM|None
7|14|Simulacrum|" By means of this spell the magic-user is able to create a duplicate of any creature. The duplicate appears exactly the same as the real. There are differences: the simulacrum will have only 51% to 60% (50% + 1% to 10%) of the hit points of the real creature, there will be personality differences, there will be areas of knowledge which the duplicate does not have, and a Detect Magic spell will instantly reveal it as a simulacrum, as will a True Seeing spell. At all times the simulacrum remains under the absolute command of the magic-user who created it, although no special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in the normal manner. The spell creates the form of the creature, but it is only a zombie-like creature. A Reincarnation spell must be used to give the duplicate a vital force, and a Limited Wish spell must be used to empower the duplicate with 40% to 65% (35% + 5% to 30%) of the knowledge and personality of the original. The level, if any, of the simulacrum, will be from 20% to 50% of the original creature. The duplicate creature is formed from ice or snow. The spell is cast over the rough form, and some piece of the creature to be duplicated must be placed inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby. The simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful, i.e. it cannot increase its levels or abilities.

7|15|Statue|When a Statue dweomer is cast, the magic-user or other creature is apparently turned to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires 1 full round after the spell is cast. Thereafter the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue, although a faint magic will be detected from the stone if it is checked for. Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Feeling is only as acute as that which will actually affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body, i.e. chipping is equal to a slight wound, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is another matter. The individual under the magic of a Statue spell can return to normal state in 1/6 of a segment, and then return to statue state in the same period if he or she so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect. During the initial transformation from flesh to stone, the creature must make a saving throw of 82% or less, with -1 deducted from the dice roll score for each point of his or her constitution score, so an 18 constitution indicates certain success. Failure indicates system shock and resultant death. The material components of this spell are lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an iron bar such as a nail or spike. |0.7|n  hours|VSM|None
7|16|Vanish|When the magic-user employs this spell, he or she causes an object to vanish. The magic-user can cause the object to be teleported (see Teleport spell) if it weighs up to a maximum of 500 g.p. per level of experience of the spell caster, i.e. 14th level magic-user can vanish and cause to reappear at his or her desired location 7000 g.p. weight. Greater objects can be made to vanish, but they are simply placed into the ethereal plane and replaced with stone. Thus, a door can be made to disappear, and it will be replaced by a stone wall of 1' thickness, or equal in thickness to the door, whichever is greater. The maximum volume of material which can be affected is 3 cubic feet per level of experience. Thus, both weight and volume limit the spell. A Dispel Magic which is successful will bring back vanished items from the ethereal plane. |0.2|Special|V|None
8|1|Sympathy/Antipathy|"This spell allows the magic-user to set up certain vibrations which will tend to either repel or attract a specific type of living, intelligent creature or characters of a particular alignment. The magic-user must decide which effect is desired with regard to what creature or alignment type before beginning the dweomercraeftlng, for the components of each application differ. The spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
ANTIPATHY: This dweomer causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or not touch the affected item. If a saving throw versus magic is successful, the creature may stay/touch the item, but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1 point of dexterity per round the area or item is remained in or touched, subject to a maximum of 4 points. Failure to save versus magic forces the creature/alignment type to abandon the magicked area or item, shunning it permanently and never willingly enter/touch it until the spell is removed or expires. The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar.
SYMPATHY: By casting the Sympathy application of the spell, the magic-user can cause a particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to be in an area or with the prospect of touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area or touch/possess the magicked object/item will be overpowering, and unless a saving throw versus magic is made, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent saving throw must be made from 1-6 turns later, and if this one fails, the affected creature will return to the area or object. The material components of this spell are 1,000 g.p. worth of crushed pearls and a drop of honey.
Note that the particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically, i.e. red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires. etc. Likewise, the specific alignment type for characters must be named, i.e. chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, etc.
If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10' per side cube can be magicked per level of experience of the magic-user. If an object or item is magicked, only that single thing can be enchanted, but affected creatures/characters save versus the magic thereon at -2. "|60|2n hours|VSM|Special
8|2|Bigby's Clenched Fist| Bigby's Clenched Fist spell brings forth a huge, disembodied hand which is balled into a fist. This magical member is under the mental control of the spell caster, and he or she can cause it to strike an opponent each round. No other spell casting or magical activity may be undertaken for the duration of the spell. The Clenched Fist never misses, but the effectiveness of its blow varies from round to round.|0.8|n|VSM|None
8|3|Clone|This spell creates a duplicate of a person. This clone is in all respects the duplicate of the individual, complete to the level of experience, memories, etc. However, the duplicate is the person, so that if the original and a duplicate exist at the same time, each knows of the other's existence; and the original person and the clone will each desire to do away with the other, for such an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If one cannot destroy the other, one (95%) will go insane (75% likely to be the clone) and destroy itself, or possibly (5%) both will become mad and commit suicide. These probabilities will occur within 1 week of the dual existence. The material component of the spell is a small piece of the flesh of the person to be duplicated. Note that the clone will become the person as he or she existed at the time at which the flesh was taken, and all subsequent knowledge, experience, etc. will be totally unknown to the clone. Also, the clone will be a physical duplicate, and possessions of the original are another matter entirely. Note that a clone takes from 2-8 months to grow, and only after that time is dual existence established. |10|P|VSM|None
8|4|Glassteel|The Glassteel spell turns crystal or glass into a transparent substance which has the tensile strength and unbreakability of actual steel. Only a relatively small volume of material can be affected, a maximum weight of 10 pounds per level of experience of the spell caster, and it must form one whole object. The material components of this spell area small piece of glass and a small piece of steel. |0.8|P|VSM|None
8|5|Incendiary Cloud|An Incendiary Cloud spell exactly resembles the smoke effects of a Pyrotechnics spell (q.v.), except that its minimum dimensions are a cloud of 10' height by 20' length and breadth. This dense vapour cloud billows forth, and on the 3rd round of its existence it begins to flame, causing ½ hit point per level of the magic-user who cast it. On the 4th round it does 1 hit point of damage per level of the caster, and on the 5th round it again drops to ½ h.p. of damage per level of the magic-user as its flames burn out. Any successive rounds of existence are simply harmless smoke which obscures vision within its confines. Creatures within the cloud need make only 1 saving throw if it is successful, but if they fail the first, they roll again an the 4th and 5th rounds (if necessary) to attempt to reduce damage sustained by one-half. In order to cast this spell the magic-user must have an available fire source (just as with a Pyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath a dung pile, and a pinch of dust..|0.2|40+(d6)10|VSM|Half
8|6|Mass Charm|" A Mass Charm spell affects either persons or monsters just as a Charm Person spell or a Charm Monster spell (qq.v.) does. The Mass Charm, however, will affect a number of creatures whose combined levels of experience and/or hit dice does not exceed twice the level of experience of the spell caster. All affected creatures must be within the spell range and within a maximum area of 3"" by 3"". Note that the creatures' saving throws are unaffected by the number of recipients (cf. Charm Person and Charm Monster), but all target creatures are subject to a penalty of -2 on the saving throw because of the efficiency and power of a Mass Charm spell.
 "|0.8|Special|V|Neg.
8|7|Maze|An extra-dimensional space is brought into being upon utterance of a Maze spell. The recipient will wander in the shifting labyrinth of force planes for a period of time which is totally dependent upon its intelligence. (Note: Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.)|0.3|Special|VS|None
8|8|Mind Blank|When the very powerful Mind Blank spell is cast, the recipient is totally protected from all devices and/or spells which detect, influence, or read emotions and/or thoughts. Protection includes Augury, Charm, Command, Confusion, Divination, empathy (all forms), ESP, Fear, Feeblemind, Mass Ssuggestion, Phantasmal Killer, possession, rulership, soul trapping, Suggestion, and telepathy. Cloaking protection also extends to prevention of discovery or information gathering by crystal balls or other scrying devices, Clairaudience, Clairvoyance, communing, contacting other planes. or Wsh-related methods (Wishing, Limited Wish, Alter Reality). Of course, exceedingly powerful deities would be able to penetrate the spell's powers. Note that this spell also protects from psionic-related detection and/or influence such as Domination (or Mass Domination), Hypnosis, Invisibility (the psionic sort is mind related), and Precognition, plus those powers which are already covered as spells. |0.1|1 day|VS|None
8|9|Monster Summoning VI|Some fukken monsters are summoned, whatever, who even cares anymore|0.8|7+n|VSM|None
8|10|Otto's Irresistable Dance|When Otto's Irresistible Dance is placed upon a creature, the spell causes the recipient to begin dancing, feet shuffling and tapping. This dance makes it impossible for the victim to do anything other than caper and prance, this cavorting lowering the armour class of the creature by -4, making saving throws impossible, and negating any consideration of a shield. Note that the creature must be touched - possibly as if melee combat were taking place and the spell caster were striking to do damage.|0.5|d4+1|V|None
8|11|Permanency|"This spell affects the duration of certain other spells, making the duration permanent. The spells upon which a personal Permanency will be effective are:
 Comprehend Languages, Detect Evil, Detect Invisibility, Detect Magic, Infravision, Protection From Evil, Protection From Normal Missiles,  Read Magic, Tongues, Unseen Servant.
The magic-user casts the desired spell and then follows with the Permanency spell. Each Permanency spell lowers the magic-users constitution by 1 point. The magic-user cannot cast these spells upon other creatures. In addition to personal use, the Permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area effect spells lasting:
 Enlarge, Fear, Gust Of Wind, Invisibility, Magic Mouth, Prismatic Sphere, Stinking Cloud, Wall Of Fire, Wall Of Force, Web.
The former application of Permanency can be dispelled only by a magic-user of greater level than the spell caster was when he or she initially cast it. The Permanency application to other spells allows it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the Permanency can be dispelled normally, and thus the entire spell negated. "|2|P|VSM|None
8|12|Polymorph Any Object|"This spell changes one object (living or otherwise) into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made at -4 on the die. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell will depend on how radically removed the original was from its magicked state, as well as how different in size. This will be determined by your Dungeon Master by comparing:
 Kingdom - animal, vegetable, mineral
 Class - mammals, bipeds, fungi, metals, spheres. etc. 
 Relationship - twig is to tree, sand is to beach, etc.
 Size - smaller, equal, larger
 Shape - comparative resemblance of the original to the polymorphed state
 Intelligence - particularly with regard to a change in which the end product is more intelligent
Change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours or turns, i.e. hours if one removed, turns if two removed. Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change of only hours duration; turning a tusk into on elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be only a change of several turns duration. All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is used upon them, they will return to their natural form. Note that a Stone To Flesh, or its reverse, will affect objects under this spell. The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke. N.B.: System shock applies to living creatures, as do the restrictions noted regarding polymorph others and stone to flesh (qq.v.). "|1|Special|VSM|Special
8|13|Power Word: Blind|When a Power Word, Blind is cast, one or more creatures within spell range and area of effect will become temporarily sightless. The spell affects up to 100 hit points of creatures, but the duration is dependent upon how many hit points of creatures are affected. If 50 or less points are affected, blindness lasts for 2 to 5 (d4+1) turns, if 51 or more hit points of creatures are affected, the spell duration is but 2 to 5 rounds. Note that the spell caster must indicate which creatures he or she desires to affect with the spell, noting one as target centre, prior to determining results. Creatures with over 100 hit points are not affected. Blindness can be removed by Cure Blindness or Dispel Magic. |0.1|Special|V|None
8|14|Serten's Spell Immunity|" By use of this spell the magic-user is able to confer virtual immunity to certain spells and magical attack forms upon those he or she touches and magicks. For every 4 levels of experience of the magic-user, 1 creature can be protected by the Serten's Spell Immunity spell, but the duration of the protection is similarly disbursed upon these additional figures. (Example: A 16th level magic-user can cast the dweomer upon 1 creature and it will last 16 turns, or he or she can place it upon 2 creatures for an 8 turn duration, or upon 4 creatures for but 4 turns duration.) The protection gives a bonus to saving throws as follows:
 Beguiling, Charm, Suggestion  +9
 Command, Domination, Fear, Hold, Scare  +7
 Geas, Quest  +5

The material component of this spell is a diamond which must be crushed and sprinkled over the spell recipients, and each such creature must also have in its possession a diamond of any size, intact and carried on its person. "|Special|10n|VSM|None
8|15|Symbol|"A Symbol spell causes the creation of magical runes which affect creatures which pass over, touch, read, or pass through a portal upon which the Symbol is inscribed. Upon casting the spell, the magic-user inscribes the Symbol upon whatever surface he or she desires. Likewise, the spell caster is able to place the Symbol of his or her choice, using any one of the following:
DEATH - One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 80 are slain.
DISCORD - All creatures are affected and immediately fall to loudly bickering and arguing; furthermore, there is a 50% probability that creatures of different alignment will attack each other. The bickering lasts for 5-20 rounds; the fighting for 2-8 rounds.
FEAR - This symbol operates as an extra-strong fear spell, causing all creatures to save vs. the spell at -4 on the die or panic and flee as if affected by a Fear spell (q.v.).
HOPELESSNESS - All creatures are affected and must turn back in dejection unless they save versus magic. Affected creatures will submit to the demands of any opponent i.e. surrender, get out, etc.; the hopelessness lasts for 3 to 12 (3d4) turns, and during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures will take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action will turn back or retire from baffle, as applicable.
INSANITY - One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 will become insane and remain so, acting as if a Confusion spell (q.v.) had been placed upon them until a Heal, Restoration, or Wish spell is used to remove the madness.
PAIN - All creatures are affected, having wracking pains shooting through their bodies, which causes them to hove -2 on dexterity and -4 on attack dice for from 2-20 turns. 
SLEEP - All creatures under 8+1 hit dice will immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 4 to 16 (d12+4) turns.
STUNNING - One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 will be stunned and reeling for 3-12 (3d4) rounds, dropping anything it or they hold in manipulative members.
The type of symbol cannot be recognized without it being read and thus activating its effects. The material components of this spell are powdered black opal and diamond dust worth not less than 1000 g.p. each. "|0.8|Special|VSM|Special
8|16|Trap the Soul|This spell is similar to the Magic Jar, except that the Trap The Soul spell forces the subject creature's life force (and its material body, if any) into a special prison magicked by the spell caster. The subject of the spell must be seen by the caster, and the magic-user must know the subject's true name as well when the final word is uttered. Preparatory to the actual casting of the Trap The Soul the magic-user must prepare the soul prison, a gem of 1,000 g.p. value for every hit die or level of experience the creature whose soul is to be trapped possesses, i.e. it requires a gem of 10,000 g.p. value to trap a 10 hit dice (or 10th level) creature by placing an Enchant An Item spell upon it and then placing a Maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison for the soul to be trapped. There are 2 manners in which the soul of the victim can be imprisoned. The final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range, but this entitles it to exercise its magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw versus magic as well, and if the latter is successful, the gem shatters. The second method of soul trapping is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word which will automatically place the creature's soul into the trap. If this method is used, it will be necessary to name the triggering item when the prison gem is magicked. A Sympathy spell may be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its soul is automatically transferred to the gem. The gem prison will hold the soul trapped until time indefinite, or until it is broken and the soul is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the creature trapped is a powerful creature from another plane (and this could actually mean a character trapped by some inhabitant of another plane of existence when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go totally free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. |Special|P|VSM|Neg.
9|1|Astral Spell|By means of the Astral Spell a cleric is able to project his or her astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his or her physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material Plane, (the plane on which the entire universe and all of its parallels have existence). Only certain magic items which have multi-planed existence can be brought into the Astral Plane. As the Astral Plane touches upon all of the first levels of the Outer Planes, the cleric can travel astrally to any of these Outer Planes as he or she wills. The cleric then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he or she has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the Astral Spell, but a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral Plane. At all times the astral body is connected to the material by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can normally cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane. the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body, and the cord simply returns to the latter where it rests on the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astrally projected persons are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing on the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the cleric desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (Dispel Magic or destruction of the cleric's body on the Prime Material Plane). The cleric can take up to five other creatures with him or her by means of the Astral Spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the cleric. These fellow travellers are dependent upon the cleric and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast according to the cleric's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the cleric. (See APPENDIX IV, THE KNOWN PLANES OF EXISTENCE, for further information on the Astral Plane and astral projection.) |0.9|Special|VS|None
9|2|Bigby's Crushing Hand| Bigby's Crushing Hand causes the appearance of a huge disembodied hand which is similar to Bigby's Forceful Hand and Bigby's Clenched Fist (qq.v.). The Crushing Hand is under the mental control of the spell caster, and he or she can cause it to grasp and squeeze an opponent. Damage from this constriction depends on the number of rounds it acts upon the victim:|0.9|n|VSM|None
9|3|Gate|The casting of a Gate spell has two effects: first, it causes an ultra-dimensional connection between the plane of existence the cleric is an and that plane on which dwells a specific being of great power, the result enabling the being to merely step through the gate or portal, from its plane to that of the cleric; second, the utterance of the spell attracts the attention of the dweller on the other plane. When casting the spell, the cleric must name the demon, devil, demi-god, god, or similar being he or she desires to make use of the Gate and come to the cleric's aid. There is a 100% certainty that something will step through the gate. The actions of the being which comes through will depend on many factors, including the alignment of the cleric, the nature of those in company with him or her, and who or what opposes or threatens the cleric. Your Dungeon Master will have a sure method of dealing with the variables of the situation. The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely) or remain to take action.|0.9|P|VS|None
9|4|Imprisonment|"When on Imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state of suspended animation (cf. Temporal Stasis) in a small sphere far below the surface of the earth. The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell, with the creature's name and background, is cast. Magical search by crystal ball, a Locate Objects spell or similar means will not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned. The reverse (Freedom) spell will cause the appearance of the victim at the spot he, she or it was entombed and sunk into the earth. There is a 10% chance that 1 to 100 other creatures will be freed from Imprisonment at the same time if the magic-user does not perfectly get the name and background of the creature to be freed. The spell only works if the name and background of the victim are known.
 "|0.9|P|VS|None
9|5|Meteor Swarm|"A Meteor Swarm is a very powerful and spectacular spell which is similar to a Fireball in many aspects. When it is cast, either four spheres of 2' diameter or eight spheres of 1' diameter spring from the outstretched hand of the magic-user and streak in a straight line up to the distance demanded by the spell caster, up to the maximum range. Any creature in the straight line path of these missiles will receive the full effect of the missile, or missiles, without benefit of a saving throw. The ""meteor"" missiles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each bursts as a Fireball (q.v.). The large spheres each do 10 to 40 hit points of damage, the four bursting in a diamond or box pattern. Each has a 3"" diameter area of effect, and each sphere will be 2"" apart, along the sides of the pattern, so that there are overlapping areas of effect, and the centre will be exposed to all four blasts. The eight small spheres have one-half diameter (1½"") and one-half the damage potential (5-20). They burst in a pattern of a box within a diamond or vice versa, each of the outer sides 2"" long. and the inner sides being 1"" long. Note that the centre will have 4 areas of overlapping effect, and there are numerous peripheral areas which have two overlapping areas of effect. A saving throw for each area of effect will indicate whether full hit points of damage, or half the indicated amount of damage, will be sustained by creatures within each area, except as already stated with regard to the missiles impacting."|0.9|I|VS|Half
9|6|Monster Summoning VII|why god why|0.9|8+n|VSM|None
9|7|Power Word: Kill|When a Power Word, Kill is uttered, one or more creatures within the spell range and area of effect will be slain. The Power Word will destroy a creature with up to 60 hit points, or it will kill 2 or more creatures with 10 or fewer hit points, up to a maximum of 20 hit points. The option to attack a single creature, or multiple creatures, must be stated along with the spell range and area of effect centre.|0.1|P|V|None
9|8|Prismatic Sphere|"This spell enables the magic-user to conjure up an opaque globe of shimmering, multi-coloured spheres of light to surround him or her which give protection from all forms of attack. This scintillating sphere flashes all the seven colours of the visible spectrum, and each of these spheres of colour has a different power and purpose. Any creature with fewer than eight hit dice will be blinded for from 2 to 8 turns by the colours of the sphere. This phenomenon is immobile and only the spell caster can pass in and out the prismatic sphere without harm. Note that typically the upper hemisphere of the globe will be visible, as the spell caster is at the centre of the sphere, so the lower half is usually hidden by the floor surface he or she is standing upon. The colours and effects of the Prismatic Sphere, as well as what will negate each globe, are:
Colour of Globe   Order of Globe   Effects of Globe  Spell Negated By
red  1st  prevents all non-magical missiles - inflicts 10 hit points of damage  Cone Of Cold
orange  2nd  prevents all magical missiles -inflicts 20 hit points of damage  Gust Of Wind
yellow  3rd  prevents poisons, gases and petrification - inflicts 40 hit points of damage  Disintegrate
green  4th  prevents all breath weapons - save vs. poison or dead   Passwall
blue  5th  prevents location/detection and psionics - save vs. petrification or turned to stone  Magic Missile
indigo  6th  prevents all magical spells - save vs. wand or insane  Continual Light
violet  7th  force field protection - save vs. magic or sent to another plane  Dispel Magic

Note that a rod of cancellation will destroy a Prismatic Sphere. Otherwise, anything entering the sphere will be destroyed, any creature subject to the effects of each and every globe as indicated, i.e. 70 hit points of damage plus death, petrification, insanity und/or instantaneous transportation to another plane, and only the four latter effects are subject to saving throws. The individual globes may be destroyed by appropriate magical attacks in consecutive order, the 1st globe destroyed before any others, then the 2nd, etc. "|0.7|10n|V|Special
9|9|Shape Change|With this spell, the magic-user is able to assume the form of any creature short of a demigod, greater devil, demon prince, singular dragon type, greater demon or the like. The spell caster becomes the creature he or she wishes, and has all of the abilities save those dependent upon intelligence, for the mind of the creature is that of the spell caster. Thus, he or she can change into a griffon, thence to an efreet, and then to a titan, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the magic-user has at the time of the Shape Change. Each alteration in form requires 1 segment. No system shock is incurred. Example: A wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp, and when this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides upon a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the magic-user can become a dragon, pool of water, or just about anything else. The material component of the spell is a jade circlet worth no less than 5000 g.p. which will shatter at the expiration of the magic's duration. In the meantime it is left in the wake of the Shape Change, and premature shattering will cause the magic to be dispelled. |0.9|10n|VSM|None
9|10|Temporal Stasis|Upon casting this spell, the magic-user places the recipient creature into a state of suspended animation. This cessation of time means that the creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease. This state persists until the magic is removed by a Dispel Magic spell or the reverse of the spell (Temporal Reinstatement) is uttered. Note that the reverse requires only a single word and no somatic or material components. The material component of a Temporal Stasis spell is a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust, one stone of each type being required. |0.9|P|VSM|None
9|11|Time Stop|Upon casting a Time Stop spell, the magic-user causes the flow of time to stop in the area of effect, and outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant. During the period of spell duration, the magic-user can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures there are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock, and the spell duration is subjective to the caster. No creature can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also, and if the magic-user leaves it, he or she immediately negates the spell. When spell duration ceases, the magic-user will again be operating in normal time. |0.9|Special|V|None
9|12|Wish|The Wish spell is a more potent version of a Limited Wish (q.v.). If it is used to alter reality with respect to hit points sustained by a party, to bring a dead character to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spell caster (and his or her party) from one place to another, it will not cause the magic-user any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, will cause the spell caster to be weak (-3 on strength) and require 2 to 8 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his or her body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the Wish spell is likely to be carried through. (This discretionary power of the referee is necessary in order to maintain game balance. As wishing another character dead would be grossly unfair, for example, your DM might well advance the spell caster to a future period where the object is no longer alive, i.e. putting the wishing character out of the campaign.) |Special|Special|V|Special
