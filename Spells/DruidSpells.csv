1|1|Animal Friendship |"By means of this spell the druid is able to show any animal which is of at least animal intelligence (but not above semi-intelligent rating) that the druid is disposed to be its friend. If the animal does not make its saving throw versus magic immediately when the spell is begun, it will stand quietly while the druid finishes the spell. Thereafter, it will follow the druid about, and he or she can teach it 3 specific ""tricks"" or tasks for each point of intelligence it possesses. (Typical tasks are those taught a dog or similar pet, i.e. they cannot be complex.) Training for each such ""trick"" must be done over a period of 1 week, and all must be done within 3 months of acquiring the creature. During the training period the animal will not harm the druid, but if the creature is left alone for more than 3 days it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly. The druid may use this spell to attract up to 2 hit dice of animal(s) per level of experience he or she possesses. This also means that the druid can never have more hit dice of animals so attracted and trained than are equal to or less than twice his or her levels of experience. Only neutral animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained. The material components of this spell ore mistletoe and a piece of food attractive to the animal subject. "|60|P|VSM|Neg.
1|2|Detect Magic |"When the Detect Magic spell is cast, the druid detects magical radiations in a path 1"" wide, and up to 3"", long, in the direction he or she is facing. The caster can turn 60° per round. Note that stone walls of 1' or more thickness, solid metal of but 1/12' thickness, or 3' or more of solid wood will black the spell. "|0.3|12|VSM|None
1|3|Detect Snares & Pits|"Upon casting this spell, the druid is able to detect snares & pits along the 1"" wide by 4"" long area of effect path and thus avoid such deadfalls. Note that in the underground only simple pits, not all forms of traps, would be detected by means of this spell. Outdoors, the spell detects all forms of traps - deadfalls, missile trips, snares, etc. The spell lasts 4 melee rounds for each level of experience of the druid casting it, i.e. 4 rounds at the 1st level, 8 at the 2nd, 12 (1 turn plus 2 rounds) at the 3rd, etc. "|0.3|4n|VSM|None
1|4|Entangle|By means of this spell the druid is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures, thus holding them fast for the duration of the spell. If any creature in the area of effect makes its saving throw, the effect of the spell is to slow its movement by 50% for the spell duration. |0.3|10|VSM|Half
1|5|Faerie Fire|"When the druid casts this spell, he or she outlines an object or creature with a pale glowing light. The completeness of the lining is dependent upon the number of linear feet the druid is able to affect, about 12' per level (i.e. one 6' man or two 3' kobolds). If there is sufficient power, several objects or creatures can be covered by the faerie fire, but one must be fully outlined before the next is begun, and all must be within the area of effect. Outlined objects or creatures (including those otherwise invisible) are visible at 8"" in the dark, 4"" if the viewer is near a bright light source. Outlined creatures are easier to strike, thus opponents gain +2 on ""to hit"" dice. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet according to the word of the druid at the time he or she casts the spell. The faerie fire does not itself cause any harm to the object or creature lined.
 "|0.3|4n|V|None
1|6|Invisibility to Animals|When an Invisibility To Animals spell is cast by a druid, the recipient of the magic becomes totally undetectable with respect to normal animals with intelligence under 6. Normal animals includes giant-sized varieties, but it excludes any with magical abilities or powers. The magicked individual is able to walk amongst animals or pass through them as if he or she did not exist. For example, this individual could stand before the hungriest of lions or a tyrannosaurus rex and not be molested or even noticed. However, a nightmare, hell hound, or winter wolf would certainly be aware of the individual. The material component of this spell is holly rubbed over the individual. |0.4|10+n|SM|None
1|7|Locate Animals|" The druid with a Locate Animals spell is able to determine the direction and distance of any of the desired animals within the area of effect. The sought after animal can be of any sort, but the druid must concentrate on the sort desired. The cleric faces in a direction, thinks of the animal desired, and he or she then knows if any such animal is within spell range. During a round of spell effect duration, the druid must face in only one direction, i.e., only a 2"" wide path can be known. The spell lasts 1 round per level of experience of the druid, while the length of the path is 2"" per level of experience. "|1|n|VSM|None
1|8|Pass Without Trace|"When this spell is cast, the recipient can move through any type of terrain - mud, snow, dust, etc. - and leave neither footprint nor scent. Thus, tracking a person or other creature covered by this dweomer is impossible. The material components of this spell are a leaf of mistletoe (which must be burned thereafter and the ashes powdered and scattered) and a sprig of pine or evergreen. Note: The area which is passed over will radiate a dweomer for 6-36 turns after the affected creature passes.
 "|1|10n|VSM|None
1|9|Predict Weather|"When a Predict Weather spell is cast by a druid, he or she gains 100% accurate knowledge of the weather (sky, temperature, precipitation) in a nine square mile area centring on the druid. For each level of experience of the druid casting the spell, two hours advance weather can be forecast. Thus, at 1st level the druid knows what the weather will be for two hours; at second level he or she knows the weather for 4 hours in advance, etc.
 "|1|120n|VSM|None
1|10|Purify Water|"This spell makes dirty, contaminated water clean and pure, suitable for consumption. Up to one cubic foot per level of the druid casting the spell can be thus purified. The reverse of the spell, Contaminate Water, works in exactly the same manner, and even holy/unholy water can be spoiled by its effects.
 "|1|P|VS|None
1|11|Shillelagh| This spell enables the druid to change his own oaken cudgel into a magical weapon which is +1 to hit and inflicts 2-8 hit points of damage on opponents up to man-sized, 2-5 hit points of damage on larger opponents. The druid must wield the shillelagh, of course. The material components of this spell are an oaken club, any mistletoe, and a shamrock leaf. |0.1|n|VSM|None
1|12|Speak with Animals| By employing this spell, the druid is empowered to comprehend and communicate with any warm or cold-blooded animal which is not mindless (such as an amoeba). The druid is able to ask questions, receive answers, and generally be on amicable terms with the animal. This ability lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the cleric employing the spell. Even if the bent of the animal is not that of the druid, it and any others of the same kind with it will not attack while the spell lasts. If the animal is  of the same general bent as the druid, there is a possibility that the animal, and its like associates, will do some favour or service for the druid. This possibility will be determined by the referee by consulting a special reaction chart, using the charisma of the druidand his actions as the major determinants. Note that this spell differs from speak with monsters (q.v.), for it allows conversation only with basically normal, non-fantastic creatures such as apes, bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on. |0.3|2n|VS|None
2|1|Barkskin|When the druid casts the Barkskin spell upon a creature, its armour class improves 1 place because the creature's skin becomes as tough as bark. In addition, saving throws versus all attack forms except magic increase by +1. This spell can be placed on the druid casting it or on any other creature he or she touches. In addition to mistletoe. the caster must have a handful of bark from an oak as the material component of the spell.|0.4|4+n|VSM|None
2|2|Charm Person or Mammal|"This spell will affect any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then will regard the druid who cast the spell as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the druid to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the druid will be viewed in its most favourable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the druid if assured that the only chance to save the druid's life is if the creature holds back an onrushing red dragon for ""just a round or two"". Note also that the spell does not empower the druid with linguistic capabilities beyond those he or she normally possesses. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a saving throw is made, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's intelligence: "|0.4|Special|VS|Neg.
2|3|Create Water|" The druid can create pure, drinkable water by means of a Create Water spell. He or she creates 1 cubic foot of water for each level of experience attained. The water can be created at a maximum distance of 1"" from the druid. "|10|P|VS|None
2|4|Cure Light Wounds|"Upon laying his or her hand upon a creature, the druid causes from 1 to 8 hit points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing will not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor will it cure wounds of creatures not living or those which can be harmed only by iron, silver, and/or magical weapons. Its reverse, Cause Light Wounds, operates in the same manner; and if a person is avoiding this touch, a melee combat ""to hit"" die is rolled to determine if the druid's hand strikes the opponent and causes such a wound. Note that cured wounds are permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage, and that caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury will. Caused light wounds are 1 to 8 hit points of damage. "|0.4|P|VSM|None
2|5|Feign Death| By means of this spell, the caster or any other creature whose levels of experience/hit dice do not exceed the magic-user's own level can be put into a cataleptic state which is impossible to distinguish from actual death. Although the person/creature affected by the Feign Death spell can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is possible; thus, any wounding or mistreatment of the body will not be felt and no reaction will occur and damage will be only one-half normal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy level drain will not affect the individual/creature under the influence of this spell, but poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body will become effective when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted. Note that only a willing individual can be affected by Feign Death. The spell caster is able to end the spell effects at any time desired, but it requires 1 full round for bodily functions to begin again|0.3|4+2n|VSM|None
2|6|Fire Trap|Any closable item (book, box, bottle. chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth) is affected by a Fire Trap spell, but the item so trapped cannot have a second spell such as Hold Portal or Wizard Lock placed upon it except as follows: if a Fire Trap/Hold Portal is attempted, only the spell first cast will work, and the other will be negated (both negated if cast simultaneously). If a Fire Trap is cast after a Wizard Lock, the former is negated, if both are cast simultaneously both are negated, and if a Wizard Lock is cast after placement of a Fire Trap there is a 50% chance that both spells will be negated. A Knock spell will not affect a Fire Trap in any way - as soon as the offending party enters/touches, the trap will discharge. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it. When the trap is discharged there will be an explosion of 5' radius, and all creatures within this area must make saving throws versus magic. Damage is 1-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per level of the magic-user who cast the spell, or one-half the total amount for creatures successfully saving versus magic. The item trapped is NOT harmed by this explosion. There is only 50% of the normal chance to detect a Fire Trap, and failure to remove it when such action is attempted detonates it immediately. To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a bit of sulphur or saltpetre. |10|P|VSM|Half
2|7|Heat Metal|By means of the Heat Metal spell, the druid is able to excite the molecules of ferrous metal (iron, iron alloys, steel) and thus cause the affected metal to become hot. On the first round of the spell, the effect is merely to cause the metal to be very warm and uncomfortable to touch, and this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration. The second and sixth (next to the last) round effect is to cause blisters and damage; the third, fourth, and fifth rounds the metal becomes searing hot, causing disability and damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: 1d4 damage when very hot, 2d4 damage when searing. Searing metal causes temporary disability in the affected areas.|0.4|7|VSM|None
2|8|Locate Plants|When this spell is used by a druid, he or she is able to locate any desired type of plant within the area of effect. Note: the plant type must be singular and concentrated upon. The spell's area of effect centres on, and moves with, the druid. |1|10n|VSM|None
2|9|Obscurement|"This spell causes a misty vapour to arise around the druid. It persists in this locale for 4 rounds per level of experience of the druid casting the spell, and it reduces visibility of any sort (including infravision) to 2' to 8' (2d4). The area of effect is a cubic progression based on the druid's level of experience, a 1"" cube at 1st level, a 2"" cube at 2nd level, a 3"" cube at 3rd level, and so on. Underground, the height of the vapour is restricted to 1"", although the length and breadth of the cloud is not so limited. A strong wind will cut the duration of an Obscurement spell by 75%. "|0.4|4n|VS|None
2|10|Produce Flame|"A bright flame, equal in brightness to a torch, springs forth from the druid's palm when he or she casts a Produce Flame spell. This magical flame lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of the druid casting the spell. The flame does not harm the druid's person. but it is hot, and it will cause combustion of inflammable materials (paper, cloth, dry wood, oil, etc.). The druid is capable of hurling the magical flame as a missile, with a range of 4"". The flame will flash on impact, igniting combustibles within a 3' diameter of its centre of impact. and then extinguish itself. The druid can cause it to go out any time he or she desires, but fire caused by the flame cannot be so extinguished. "|0.4|2n|VSM|None
2|11|Trip|The spell caster must use a length of vine, a stick, pole, rope, or similar object to cast this magic upon. The Trip spell causes the object to rise slightly off the ground or floor it is resting on and trip creatures crossing it if they fail to make their saving throw versus magic. Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the magicked object, i.e. a 3' long piece of rope could trip only 1 man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped will take 1-6 (d6) hit points of damage and be stunned for 2-5 (d4+1) rounds if the surface they full upon is very hard, but if it is turf or non-hard they will merely be stunned for 2-5 segments. Very large creatures such as elephants will not be at all affected by a Trip. The object magicked will continue to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spell caster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures aware of the object and its potential add +4 to their saving throw when crossing it. The object is 80% undetectable without magical means of detection. |0.5|10n|VSM|Neg.
2|12|Warp Wood|"When this spell is cast the druid causes a volume of wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form and strength. The range of a Warp Wood spell is 1"" for each level of experience of the druid casting it. It affects approximately a fifteen inch shaft of wood of up to one inch diameter per level of the druid. Thus, at 1st level, a druid might be able to warp a hand axe handle, or four crossbow bolts, at 5th level he or she could warp the shaft of a typical magic spear. Note that boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak."|0.4|P|VSM|None
3|1|Call Lightning|"When a Call Lightning spell is cast, there must be a storm of some sort in the area - a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado. The druid is then able to call down belts of lightning from sky to ground. Each bolt will cause damage equal to 2 eight-sided dice (2d8) plus 1 like die (d8) for each level of experience of the druid casting the spell. Thus, a 4th level druid calls down a six-die (6d8) bolt. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a perpendicular stroke at whatever distance the spell caster decides, up to the 36"" radial distance maximum. Any creature within a 1"" radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes will take full damage, unless a saving throw is made, in which case only one-half damage is taken. Full/half damage refers to the number of hit dice of the lightning bolt, i.e. if it is of eight dice strength, the victim will take either eight dice (8d8) or four dice (4d8), if the saving throw is made, of damage. The druid is able to call one bolt of lightning every 10 melee rounds (1 turn), to a maximum number of turns equal to the level of experience he or she has attained, i.e. 1 bolt/turn for each level of experience. Note: This spell is normally usable outdoors only. "|10|10n|VSM|Half
3|2|Cure Disease|The cleric cures most diseases - including those of a parasitic, bacterial, or viral nature - by placing his or her hand upon the diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured creature whole and well in from 1 turn to 1 week, depending on the kind of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. The reverse of the Cure Disease spell is Cause Disease. To be effective. the cleric must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail the saving throw. The disease caused will begin to affect the victim in 16 turns, causing the afflicted creature to lose 1 hit point per turn, and 1 point of strength per hour, until the creature is at 10% of original hit points and strength, at which time the afflicted is weak and virtually helpless. |1|P|VSM|None
3|3|Hold Animal|By means of this spell the druid holds one to four animals rigid. Animals affected are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, or reptiles, but not monsters such as centaurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. That is, apes, bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant beavers, and similar animals are subject to this spell. The hold lasts for 2 melee rounds per level of experience of the druid casting it. It is up to the druid as to how many animals he or she wishes to hold with the spell, but the greater the number, the better chance each will have of not being affected by the spell. Note that a maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds with respect to non-mammals)/animal/level of experience of the druid can be affected, i.e. an 8th level druid can affect up to four 3,200 pound mammals or a like number of 800 pound non-mammals such as birds or reptiles. Each animal gets a saving throw: if only 1 is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its die roll to save; if 2 are subject, they each receive a penalty of -2 on their die rolls; if 3 are subject, they each receive a penalty of -1 on their die rolls; if 4 are subject, each makes a normal saving throw.  |0.5|2n|VSM|Neg.
3|4|Neutralize Poison|" By means of a Neutralize Poison spell, the cleric detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or substance touched. Note that an opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an opponent) unwilling to be so touched requires the cleric to score a hit in melee combat. Effects of the spell are permanent only with respect to poison existing in the touched creature at the time of the touch, i.e. creatures (or objects) which generate new poison will not be permanently detoxified. The reversed spell, Poison, likewise requires an attack (a ""to hit"" touch which succeeds), and the victim is allowed a saving throw versus poison. If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is killed by the poison."|0.5|P|VS|None
3|5|Plant Growth|" When a Plant Growth spell is cast by the druid, he or she causes normal vegetation a grow, entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or jungle which creatures must hack or force a way through at a movement rate of 1"" per, or 2"" per with respect to larger than man-sized creatures. Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order to allow this spell to go into effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is 2"" x 2"" square per level of experience of the druid, in any square or rectangular shape that the druid decides upon at the time of the spell casting. Thus an 8th level druid can affect a maximum area of 16"" x 16"" square, a 32"" x 8"" rectangle, a 64"" X 4"" rectangle, 128"" x 2"" rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labour, fire, or such magical means as a Dispel Magic spell (q.v.) "|1|P|VSM|None
3|6|Protection from Fire|The effect of a Protection From Fire spell differs according to the recipient of the magic - the druid or some other creature. If the spell is cast upon the druid, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and to exposure to magical fires such as demon fire, burning hands, fiery dragon breath, Fireball, Fire Seeds, Fire Storm, Flame Strike, hell hound breath, Meteor Swarm, pyrohydra breath, etc. until an accumulation of 12 hit points of potential damage per level of experience of the druid has been absorbed by the Protection From Fire spell, at which time the spell is negated. Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn per level of experience of the druid. If the spell is cast upon another creature, it gives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a bonus of +4 on saving throw die rolls made versus fire attacks, and reduces damage sustained from magical fires by 50%. |0.5|Special|VSM|None
3|7|Pyrotechnics|"A Pyrotechnics spell can have either of two effects. It produces a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, coloured aerial fireworks which lasts 1 segment per experience level of the druid casting the spell and temporarily blinds those creatures in the area of effect or under it or within 12"" of the area (and in any event in unobstructed line of sight); or it causes a thick writhing stream of smoke to arise from the fire source of the spell and form a choking cloud which lasts for 1 round per experience level of the druid casting it, covering a roughly globular area from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area), which totally obscures vision beyond 2'. The spell requires a fire of some sort in range. The area of Pyrotechnics effect is 10 times the volume of the fire source with respect to fireworks, 100 times with respect to smoke. In either case, the fire source is immediately extinguished by the employment of the spell."|0.5|Special|VSM|None
3|8|Snare|This spell enables the druid to make a snare which is 90% undetectable without magical aid. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When the Snare spell is cast upon it, the cordlike object blends with the background of its location. One end of the snare is tied in a loop which will contract about 1 or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could also be thus ensnared). If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare will be fastened to it, and the dweomer of the spell will cause it to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, thus causing 1-6 hit points of damage to the creature trapped, and lifting off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available, the cord-like object will tighten upon the member(s) and then enwrap the entire creature, doing no damage, but tightly binding it. The snare is magical, so for 1 hour it is breakable only by storm giant or greater strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour - 22 after 2 hours, 21 after 3, 20 after 4 - until 6 full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18 strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of the snare lose all of the magical properties, and the loop opens, freeing anything it had held. The druid must have a snake skin and a piece of sinew from a strong animal to weave into the cord-like object from which he or she will make the snare. Only mistletoe is otherwise needed.|3|P|VSM|None
3|9|Stone Shape| By means of this spell the magic-user can form an existing piece of stone into a shape which will suit his or her purposes. For example, a stone weapon can be made, a special trapdoor fashioned, or an idol sculpted. By the same token, it would allow the spell caster to reshape a stone door, perhaps, so as to escape imprisonment providing the volume of stone involved was within the limits of the area of effect. While stone coffers can be thus formed, secret doors made, etc., the fineness of detail is not great. The material component of this spell is soft clay which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone when the spell is uttered. |1|P|VSM|None
3|10|Summon Insects|When a Summon Insects spell is cast by a druid, he or she attracts flying insects 70% of the time. The exact insects called will be bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps if flying insects are indicated, or biting ants or pinching beetles if non-flying insects are determined. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, will appear after the spell is cast. They will attack any creature the druid points to. The attacked creature will sustain 2 hit points of damage per melee round, and it can do nothing but attempt to fend off these insects during the time it is so attacked. The summoned insects can be caused to attack another opponent. but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former recipient and attack the new victim, and crawling insects can travel only about 12' per round (maximum speed over smooth ground). It is possible in underground situations that the druid could summon 1-4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. The materials needed for this spell are mistletoe, a flower and a bit of mud or wet clay. |1|n|VSM|None
3|11|Tree| By means of this spell the druid is able to assume the form of a small living tree or shrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with but a few limbs. Although the closest inspection will not reveal that this plant is actually a druid, and for all normal tests he or she is, in fact, a tree or shrub, the druid is able to observe all that goes on around his or her person just as if he or she were in human form. The spell caster may remove the dweomer at any time he or she desires, instantly changing from plant to human form, and having full capability of undertaking any action normally possible to the druid. Note that all clothing and gear worn/carried change with the druid. The material components of this spell are mistletoe and a twig from a tree.|0.5|60+10n|VSM|None
3|12|Water Breathing| The recipient of a Water Breathing spell is able to freely breathe underwater for the duration of the spell, i.e. 6 turns for each level of experience of the druid casting the spell. The reverse, Air Breathing, allows water breathing creatures to comfortably survive in the atmosphere for an equal duration. |0.5|60n|VSM|None
4|1|Animal Summoning I| By means of this spell, the druid calls up to eight animals of whatever sort the druid names when the summoning is made, if such type are within spell range. These animals can have no more than four hit dice each. The animals summoned will aid the druid by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the druid is safe, he or she sends them away, etc. The druid may try three times to summon three different sorts of animals, i.e. suppose that wild dogs are first summoned to no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and finally the druid calls for wild horses which may or may not be within summoning range. Your referee will determine probabilities if the presence of a summoned animal type is not known. Other than various sorts of giant animals, fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned lay this spell, i.e. no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc. |0.6|Special|VSM|None
4|2|Call Woodland Beings|"By means of this spell the druid is able to summon certain woodland creatures to his or her location. Naturally, this spell will only work outdoors, but not necessarily only in wooded areas. The druid begins the incantation, and the spell must be continued uninterrupted until some called creature appears or 2 turns have elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly exhausting to the spell caster.) Only 1 type of the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell, and they will come only if they are within the range of the call: The creature(s) called by the spell are entitled to a saving throw versus magic (at -4) to avoid the summons. Any woodland being answering the call will be favourably disposed to the spell caster and give whatever aid it is capable of. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment, the creatures are entitled to another saving throw versus magic (this time at +4) when they come within 1"" of the druid or other evil character with him or her, and these beings will seek immediately to escape if the saving throw is successful. In any event, if the druid requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on behalf of the druid, they are required to make a loyalty reaction score based on the druid's charisma and whatever dealings he or she has had with the called creature(s). The material components of this spell are a pinecone and 8 holly berries. "|Special|Special|VSM|Neg.
4|3|Control Temperature, r=10'|When this spell is cast by the druid, the temperature surrounding the druid can be altered by 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5ºC) per level of experience of the spell caster, either upwards or downwards. Thus, a 10th level druid could raise the surrounding temperature from 1 to 90 degrees (1-50ºC) or lower it by from 1 to 90 degrees (1-50ºC). The spell lasts for a number of turns equal to 4 plus the level of experience of the druid, i.e. when cast by a 10th level druid the spell persists for 14 turns.|0.6|40+10n|VSM|None
4|4|Cure Serious Wounds| This spell is a more potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell (q.v.). Upon laying his or her hand upon a creature, the cleric causes from 3 to 17 (2d8+1) hit points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing will affect only those creatures listed in the Cure Light Wounds spell explanation. Cause Serious Wounds, the reverse of the spell, operates similarly to the Cause Light Wounds spell, the victim having to be touched first, and if the touch is successful, it will inflict 3 to 17 hit points. |0.6|P|VSM|None
4|5|Dispel Magic|When a cleric casts this spell, it neutralizes or negates the magic it comes in contact with as follows: A Dispel Magic will not affect a specially enchanted item such as a scroll, magic ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous magic item, magic weapon, magic shield, or magic armour. It will destroy magic potions (they are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell), remove spells cast upon persons or objects, or counter the casting of spells in the area of effect. The base chance for success of a Dispel Magic spell is 50%. For every level of experience of the character casting the Dispel Magic above that of the creature whose magic is to be dispelled (or above the efficiency level of the object from which the magic is issuing), the base chance increases by 5%, so that if there are 10 levels of difference, there is a 100% chance. For every level below the experience/efficiency level of the creature/object, the base chance is reduced by 2%. Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. It is automatic in negating the spell caster's own magic.|0.6|P|VSM|None
4|6|Hallucinatory Forest|"By casting this spell the druid causes the appearance of an Hallucinatory Forest to come into existence. The Illusionary forest appears to be perfectly natural and is indistinguishable from a real forest. Other druids - as well as such creatures as centaurs, dryads, green dragons, nymphs, satyrs, and treants - will recognize the forest for what it is. All other creatures will believe it is there, and movement and order of march will be affected accordingly. The Hallucinatory Forest will remain until it is magically dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a Dispel Magic. The area shape is either rectangular or square, in general, at least 4"" deep, and in whatever location the druid casting the spell desires. The forest can be of less than maximum area if the druid wishes. One of its edges will appear up to 8"" away from the druid, according to the desire of the spell caster. "|0.6|P|VSM|None
4|7|Hold Plant| The Hold Plant spell affects vegetable matter as follows: 1) it causes ambulatory vegetation to cease moving; 2) it prevents vegetable matter from entwining, grasping, closing. or growing; 3) it prevents vegetable matter from making any sound or movement which is not caused by wind. The spell effects apply to all forms of vegetation, including parasitic and fungoid types, and those magically animated or otherwise magically empowered. It affects such monsters as green slime, moulds of any sort, shambling mounds. shriekers, treants, etc. The duration of a Hold Plant spell is 1 melee round per level of experience of the druid casting the spell. It affects from 1 to 4 plants - or from 4 to 16 square yards of small ground growth such as grass or mould. If but one plant (or 4 square yards) is chosen as the target for the spell by the druid, the saving throw of the plant (or area of plant growth) is made at a -4 on the die; if two plants (or 8 square yards) are the target, saving throws are at -2; if three plants (or 12 square yards) are the target, saving throws are at -1; and if the maximum of 4 plants (or 16 square yards of area) are the target, saving throws are normal.|0.8|n|VSM|Neg.
4|8|Plant Door| The Plant Door spell opens a magical portal or passageway through trees, undergrowth, thickets, or any similar growth - even growth of a magical nature. The Plant Door is open only to the druid who cast the spell, druids of a higher level, or dryads. The door even enables the druid to enter into a solid tree trunk and remain hidden there until the spell ends. If the tree is cut down or burned, the druid must leave before the tree falls or is consumed, or else he or she is killed also. The duration of the spell is 1 turn per level of experience of the druid casting it. If the druid opts to stay within an oak, the spell lasts 9 times longer, if an ash tree it lasts 2 times as long. The path created by the spell is up to 4' wide, 8' high and 12'/level of experience of the druid long. |0.6|10n|VSM|None
4|9|Produce Fire|By means of this spell the druid causes a common-type fire of up to 12' per side in area boundary. While it lasts but a single round, the fire produced by the spell will cause 1-4 hit points of damage on creatures within its area; and it will ignite combustible materials such as cloth, oil, paper, parchment, wood and the like so as to cause continued burning. The reverse, Quench Fire will extinguish any normal fire (coals, oil, tallow, wax, wood, etc.) within the area of effect.|0.6|1|VSM|None
4|10|Protection from Lightning|The effect of a Protection From Lightning spell differs according to the recipient of the magic - the druid or some other creature. If the spell is cast upon the druid, it confers complete invulnerability to normal lightning and to exposure to magical lightning until an accumulation of 12 hit points of potential damage per level of experience of the druid has been absorbed by the Protection From Lightning spell, at which time the spell is negated. Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn per level of experience of the druid. If the spell is cast upon another creature, it gives invulnerability to normal lightning, gives a bonus of +4 on saving throw die rolls made versus lightning attacks, and reduces damage sustained from magical lightnings by 50%. |0.6|Special|VSM|None
4|11|Repel Insects|When this spell is cast the druid creates an invisible barrier to all sorts of insects, and normal sorts will not approach within 10' of the druid while the spell is in effect although any giant insects with 2 or more hit dice will do so if they make a saving throw versus magic, and even those which do so will sustain 1-6 hit points of damage from the passing of the magical barrier. Note that the spell does not in any way affect arachnids, myriapods, and similar creatures - it affects only true insects. The material components of the Repel Insects spell are mistletoe and one of the following: several crushed marigold flowers, a whole crushed leek, 7 crushed stinging nettle leaves or a small lump of resin from a camphor tree.|1|10n|VSM|None
4|12|Speak with Plants|"When cast, a Speak With Plants spell enables the cleric to converse, in very rudimentary terms, with all sorts of living vegetables. Thus, the cleric can question plants as to whether or not creatures have passed through them, cause thickets to part to enable easy passage, require vines to entangle pursuers, and similar things. The spell does not enable the cleric to animate non-ambulatory vegetation. The power of the spell lasts for 1 melee round for each level of experience of the cleric who cast it. All vegetation within the area of effect are under command of the spell. The material components for this spell are a drop of water, a pinch of dung, and a flame.
 "|10|2n|VSM|None
5|1|Animal Growth|"When this spell is cast, the druid causes all animals, up to a maximum of 8, within a 2"" square area to grow to twice their normal size. The effects of this growth are doubled hit dice (with resultant improvement in attack potential) and doubled damage in combat. The spell lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the druid casting the spell. Note that the spell is particularly useful in conjunction with a Charm Person or Mammal or a Speak With Animals spell. The reverse reduces animal size by one half, and likewise reduces hit dice, attack damage, etc."|0.7|2n|VSM|None
5|2|Animal Summoning II| By means of this spell, the druid calls up to twelve animals of level 4 or less; or, up to six animals of level 8 or less, whatever sort the druid names when the summoning is made, if such type are within spell range. These animals can have no more than four hit dice each. The animals summoned will aid the druid by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the druid is safe, he or she sends them away, etc. The druid may try three times to summon three different sorts of animals, i.e. suppose that wild dogs are first summoned to no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and finally the druid calls for wild horses which may or may not be within summoning range. Your referee will determine probabilities if the presence of a summoned animal type is not known. Other than various sorts of giant animals, fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned lay this spell, i.e. no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc. |0.7|Special|VSM|None
5|3|Anti-Plant Shell| The Anti-Plant Shell spell creates an invisible barrier which keeps out all creatures or missiles of living vegetable material. Thus, the druid (and any creatures within the shell) is protected from attacking plants or vegetable creatures such as shambling mounds or treants. The spell lasts for one turn per level of experience of the druid. |0.7|10n|VSM|None
5|4|Commune with Nature|"This spell enables the druid to become one with nature in the area, thus being empowered with knowledge of the surrounding territory. For each level of experience of the druid, he or she may ""know"" one fact, i.e. the ground ahead, left or right, the plants ahead, left or right, the minerals ahead, left or right, the water courses/bodies of water ahead, left or right, the people dwelling ahead, left or right, etc. The spell is effective only in outdoors settings, and operates in a radius of one half mile for each level of experience of the druid casting the Commune With Nature spell. "|10|Special|VSM|None
5|5|Control Winds|"By means of a Control Winds spell the druid is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every level of his or her experience, the druid is able to increase or decrease wind force by 3 miles per hour. Winds in excess of 30 miles per hour drive small flying creatures (those eagle-sized and under) from the skies and severely inhibit missile discharge. Winds in excess of 45 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies. Winds in excess of 60 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies and uproot trees of small size, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, etc. Winds in excess of 75 miles per hour are of hurricane force and cause devastation to all save the strongest stone constructions. A wind above 30 miles per hour makes sailing difficult, above 45 miles per hour causes minor ship damage, above 60 miles per hour endangers ships, and above 75 miles per hour sinks ships. There is an ""eye"" of 4"" radius around the druid where the wind is calm. A higher level druid can use a Control Winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell cast by a lower level druid (cf. control weather). The spell remains in force for 1 turn for each level of experience of the druid casting it. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases by 3 miles per hour per round until maximum speed is attained. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind diminishes at the same rate. Note that while the spell can be used in underground places, the ""eye"" will shrink in direct proportion to any confinement of the wind effect, i.e. if the area of effect is a 48"" radius, and the confined space allows only a 46"" radius, the ""eye"" will be 2"" radius; and any space under 44"" radius will completely eliminate the ""eye"" and subject the spell caster to the effects of the wind."|0.7|10n|VSM|None
5|6|Insect Plague|" When this spell is cast by the cleric, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects swarm in a thick cloud. These insects obscure vision, limiting it to 3"". Creatures within the insect plague sustain 1 hit point of damage for each melee round they remain in it due to the bites and stings of the insects, regardless of armour class. The referee will cause all creatures with fewer than five hit dice to check morale. Creatures with two or fewer hit dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a straight line in a random direction until they are not less than 24"" distant from the cloud of insects. Creatures with fewer than five hit dice which fail their morale check will behave likewise. Heavy smoke will drive off insects within its bounds. Fire will also drive insects away; a Wall of Fire in a ring shape will keep the Insect Plague outside its confines, but a Fireball will simply clear insects from its blast area for 1 turn. Lightning and cold/ice act likewise. The plague lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric casting the spell, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area which centres around a summoning point determined by the spell caster, which point can be up to 36"" distant from the cleric. The Insect Plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by casting a Dispel Magic upon the summoning point. A cube of force (a special magic item) would keep insects away from a character seeking the centre of the swarm, but invisibility would afford no protection. The material components of this spell area few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat. "|10|10n|VSM|None
5|7|Pass Plant|"By using this spell, a druid is able to enter a tree and move from inside it to another of the same type which lies in approximately the direction desired by the spell user and is within several furlongs. The tree entered and that receiving the druid must be of the same type, living, and of girth at least equal to the druid. Note that if the druid enters a tree, suppose an ash, and wishes to pass north as far us possible (54""), but the only appropriate ash in range is south, the druid will pass to the ash in the south. The Pass Plant spell functions so that the movement takes only one segment (6 seconds) of a round. The druid may, at his or her option, remain within the receiving tree for a maximum of 1 round per level of experience. Otherwise, he or she may step forth immediately. Should no like tree be in range, the druid simply remains within the tree, does not pass elsewhere, and must step forth in the applicable number of rounds. (See Plant Door for effects of chopping or burning such a tree.) "|0.7|Special|VSM|None
5|8|Sticks to Snakes| By means of this spell the cleric is able to change 1 stick to a snake for each level of experience he or she has attained, i.e. a 9th level cleric can change 9 sticks into 9 snakes. These snakes will attack as commanded by the cleric. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Note that magical items such as staves and spears which are enchanted are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect will be changed. The probability of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per level of experience of the spell caster, so that there is a 55% probability of any given snake created by the spell being poisonous when sticks are turned to snakes by an 11th level cleric, 60% at 12th level, etc. The effect lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the spell caster. The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales. The reverse changes snakes to sticks for the duration appropriate, or it negates the Sticks To Snakes spell according to the level of the cleric countering the spell, i.e. a 10th level cleric casting the reverse spell can turn only 10 snakes back to sticks. |0.7|2n|VSM|None
5|9|Transmute Rock to Mud|" This spell turns natural rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. The depth of the mud can never exceed one-half its length and/or breadth. If it is cast upon a rock, for example, the rock affected will collapse into mud. Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud will sink and suffocate, save for lightweight creatures which could normally pass across such ground. The mud will remain until a dispel magic spell or a reverse of this spell, Mud To Rock, restores its substance - but not necessarily its form. Evaporation will turn the mud to normal dirt, from 1 to 6 days per cubic 1"" being required. The exact time depends on exposure to sun, wind and normal drainage. The Mud To Rock reverse will harden normal mud into soft stone (sandstone or similar mineral) permanently unless magically changed."|0.7|Special|VSM|None
5|10|Wall of Fire|"The Wall Of Fire spell brings forth a blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering colour - yellow-green or amber in case of druidical magic. The Wall Of Fire inflicts 4 to 16 hit points of damage, plus 1 hit point of damage per level of the spell caster, upon any creature passing through it. Creatures within 1"" of the wall take 2-8 hit points of damage, those within 2"", take 1-4 hit points of damage. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Only the side of the wall away from the spell caster will inflict damage. The opaque Wall Of Fire lasts for as long as the druid concentrates on maintaining it, or 1 round per level of experience of the druid in the event he or she does not wish to concentrate upon it. The spell creates a sheet of flame up to 2"" square per level of the spell caster, or as a ring with a radius of up to ½"" per level of experience from the druid to its flames, and a height of 2"". The former is stationary, while the latter moves as the druid moves."|0.7|Special|VSM|None
6|1|Animal Summoning III| By means of this spell, the druid calls up to sixteen animals of level 4 or less; or, up to eight animals of level 8 or less; or, up to four animals of level 16 or less, whatever sort the druid names when the summoning is made, if such type are within spell range. These animals can have no more than four hit dice each. The animals summoned will aid the druid by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the druid is safe, he or she sends them away, etc. The druid may try three times to summon three different sorts of animals, i.e. suppose that wild dogs are first summoned to no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and finally the druid calls for wild horses which may or may not be within summoning range. Your referee will determine probabilities if the presence of a summoned animal type is not known. Other than various sorts of giant animals, fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned lay this spell, i.e. no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc. |0.8|Special|VSM|None
6|2|Anti-Animal Shell|By casting this spell the druid brings into being a hemispherical force field which prevents the entrance of any sort of animal matter of normal (not magical) nature. Thus, a giant would be kept out, but undead could pass through the shell of force, as could such monsters as aerial servants, demons, devils, etc. The Anti-Animal Shell lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience the druid has attained. |1|10n|VSM|None
6|3|Conjure Fire Elemental|Upon casting a Conjure Fire Elemental spell, the druid opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a strong fire elemental (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL) is summoned to the vicinity of the spell caster. It is 85% likely that a 16 die elemental will appear, 9% likely that 2 to 4 salamanders (q.v.) will come, a 4% chance exists that an efreeti (q.v.) will come, and a 2% chance exists that a huge fire elemental of 21 to 24 hit dice (d4 + 20) will appear. Because of the relationship of druids to natural and elemental forces, the conjuring druid need not fear that the elemental force summoned will turn on him or her, so concentration upon the activities of the fire elemental (or other creature, summoned) or the protection of a magic circle is not necessary. The elemental summoned will help the druid however possible, including attacking opponents of the druid. The fire elemental or other creature summoned remains for a maximum of 1 turn per level of the druid casting the spell - or until it is sent back by attack, a Dispel Magic spell or the reverse of the spell (Dismiss Fire Elemental). Only a druid can dismiss summoned salamanders, efreeti, or ultra-powerful elemental. |6|10n|VSM|None
6|4|Cure Critical Wounds|The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell (q.v.). The cleric lays his or her hand upon a creature and heals from 6 to 27 (3d8+3) hit points of damage from wounds or other damage. The spell does not affect creatures excluded in the Cure Light Wounds spell explanation. Its reverse, Cause Critical Wounds, operates in the same fashion as other Cause Wounds spells, requiring a successful touch to inflict the 6-27 hit points of damage. Caused wounds heal as do wounds of other sorts. |0.8|P|VSM|None
6|5|Feeblemind|A spell which is solely for employment against those persons or creatures who use magic spells, Feeblemind causes the victim's brain to become that of a moronic child. The victim remains in this state until a Heal, Restoration or Wish spell is used to do away with the effects. The spell is of such a nature that the probability of it affecting the target creature is generally enhanced, i.e. saving throws are lowered. |0.8|P|VS|Neg.
6|6|Fire Seeds|"The spell of Fire Seeds creates special missiles or timed incendiaries which burn with great heat. The druid may hurl these seeds up to 4"" or place them to ignite upon a command word. Acorns become fire seed missiles, while holly berries are used as the timed incendiaries. The spell creates up to four acorn fire seeds or eight holly berry fire seeds. The acorns burst upon striking their target, causing 2 to 16 hit points (2d8) of damage and igniting any combustible materials within a 1"" diameter of the point of impact. Although the holly berries are too light to make effective missiles, they can be placed, or tossed up to 6' away, to burst into flame upon a word of command. The berries ignite causing 1 to 8 hit points (d8) of damage to any creature in a ½"" diameter burst area, and their fire ignites combustibles in the burst area. The command range for holly berry fire seeds is 4"". All fire seeds lose their power after the expiration of 1 turn per level of experience of the druid casting the spell, i.e. a 13th level druid has fire seeds which will remain potent for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation. Targets of acorn fire seeds must be struck by the missile. If a saving throw is made, creatures within the burst area take only one-half damage, but creatures struck directly always take full damage. Note that no mistletoe or other material components beyond acorns or holly berries are needed for this spell."|Special|Special|VSM|Half
6|7|Transport Via Plants| By means of this spell, the druid is able to enter any large plant and pass any distance to a plant of the same species in o single round regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to the druid, but it also must be alive. If the druid is uncertain of the destination plant, he or she need merely determines direction and distance, and the Transport Via Plants spell will move him or her as near as possible to the desired location. There is a basic 20% chance, reduced 1% per level of experience of the druid, that the transport will deliver the druid to an allied species of plant from 1 to 100 miles removed from the desired destination plant. If a particular destination plant is desired, but the plant is not living, the spell fails, and the druid must come forth from the entrance plant within 24 hours. Harm to a plant housing a druid can affect the druid (cf. Plant Door).  |0.3|Special|VS|None
6|8|Turn Wood|"When this spell is cast, waves of force roll forth from the druid, moving in the direction he or she faces, and causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from the druid to the limit of the area of effect. Wooden objects above three inches diameter which are fixed firmly will not be affected, but loose objects (movable mantlets, siege towers, etc.) will move back. Objects under 3 inches diameter which are fixed will splinter and break and the pieces will move with the wave of force. Thus, objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts will be pushed back, dragging those carrying them with them; and if a spear is planted in order to prevent this forced movement, it will splinter. The Turn Wood spell lasts for 4 rounds per level of experience of the druid casting it, and the waves of force will continue to sweep down the set path for this period. The wooden objects in the area of effect are pushed back at a rate of 4"" per melee round. The length of the path is 2"" per level of the druid, i.e. a 14th level druid casts a Turn Wood spell with an area of effect 12"" wide by 28"" long, and the spell would last for 56 rounds (5.6 turns). As usual, the above assumes the druid is using greater mistletoe when casting the spell. Note that after casting the spell the path is set, and the druid may then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power. "|0.8|4n|VSM|None
6|9|Wall of Thorns|" The Wall Of Thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable green angled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature breaking through (or merely impacting upon) the Wall Of Thorns takes 8 hit points of damage plus an additional amount of hit points equal to the creature's armour class, i.e. 10 or fewer additional hit points of damage, with negative armour classes subtracting from the base 8 hit points of damage. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast is considered to have impacted on the wall of thorns and in addition must break through to gain movement space. The damage is based on each 1"" thickness of the barrier. If the Wall Of Thorns is chopped at, it will take at least 4 turns to cut a path through a 1"" thickness. Normal fire will not harm the barrier, but magical fires will burn away the barrier in 2 turns with the effect of creating a wall of fire while doing so (see Wall Of Fire spell.) The nearest edge of the Wall Of Thorns appears up to 8"" distant from the druid, as he or she desires. The spell lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience of the druid casting it, and covers an area of ten cubic inches per level of the caster in whatever form the caster desires. Thus a 14th level druid could create a Wall Of Thorns 7"" long by 2"" high (or deep) by)"" deep (or high), a 1"" high by 1"" wide by 14"" long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his or her needs. "|0.8|10n|VSM|None
6|10|Weather Summoning|"The druidic Weather Summoning spell is similar to the Control Weather spell (q.v.) of clerical nature. By casting the spell, the druid calls forth weather commensurate with the climate and season of the area he or she is in at the time, Thus, in spring a tornado, thunderstorm, cold, sleet storm, or hot weather could be summoned. In summer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm, etc. can be called for. In autumn, hot or cold weather, fog, sleet, etc. could be summoned. Winter allows great cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the late winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the druid. It might last but a single turn in the case of a tornado, or for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 or more square miles. Note that several druids can act in concert to greatly affect weather, controlling winds and/or working jointly to summon very extreme weather conditions. Within 4 turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather to come will be apparent, i.e., clearing skies, gusts of warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast skies, etc. Summoned weather will arrive 6 to 17 turns (d12 + 5) after the spell is cast. Anything less than greater mistletoe as the material component will sharply curtail the weather extremes desired.
 "|10|Special|VSM|None
7|1|Animate Rock|By employing an Animate Rock spell, the druid causes a lithic object of a size up to that indicated to move (see Animate Object, the sixth level cleric spell.) The animated stone object must be separate, i.e. not a piece of a huge boulder or the like. It will follow the desire of the druid casting the spell - attacking, breaking objects, blocking - while the magic lasts. It has no intelligence nor volition of its own, but it follows instructions exactly as spoken. Note that only one set of instructions for one single action (the whole being simply worded and very brief - 12 words or so), can be given to the rock animated. The rock remains animated for 1 melee round per level of experience of the spell caster, and the volume of rock which can be animated is also based on the experience level of the druid - 2 cubic feet of stone per level, i.e. 24 cubic feet at the 12th level. |0.9|n|VSM|None
7|2|Chariot of Sustarre|"When this spell is cast by a druid, it brings forth a large flaming chariot pulled by two fiery horses which appear in a clap of thunder amidst cloud-like smoke. This vehicle moves at 24"" on the ground, 48"" flying, and it can carry the druid and up to 8 other man-sized creatures whom he or she first touches so as to enable these creatures to be able to ride aboard this burning transport. Creatures other than the druid and his or her designated passengers will sustain damage equal to that of a Wall Of Fire spell if they are within 5' of the horses or chariot, voluntarily or involuntarily. The druid controls the chariot by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds to stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, turning left or right as he or she desires. Note that the Chariot Of Sustarre is a physical manifestation, and can sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water one quart of which will cause 1 hit point of damage), they are armour class 2, and each requires 30 hit points of damage to dispel. Naturally, fire has absolutely no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires will affect the riders if they are exposed to them (other than those of the chariot itself}. In addition to mistletoe, the druid casting this spell must have a small piece of wood, 2 holly berries, and a fire source at least equal too torch. "|10|60+10n|VSM|None
7|3|Confusion|"This spell causes Confusion in one or more creatures within spell range. (Confused creatures will react as follows: 01-10: Wander away for 1 turn; 11-60: Stand confused for 1 round; 61-80: Attack nearest creature for 1 round; 81-00: Attack druid or his party for 1 round.) The spell lasts for 1 melee round for each level of experience of the spell caster. It will affect 2 to 8 creatures, plus a possible additional number of creatures determined by subtracting the level or number of hit dice of the strongest opponent creature within the spell range and area of effect from the level of the druid who cast the spell of Confusion. If a positive number results, it is added to the random die roll result for number of creatures affected; a negative number is ignored. All creatures affected will be those closest to the druid within the area of effect. Each affected creature must make a saving throw each round, unless they are caused to ""wander away for 1 turn"" in which case they will go as far away from the druid as is possible in one turn of normal movement, as conditions permit. All saving throws are at -2. Confused creatures act according to the table of actions shown above, but saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. "|0.9|n|VSM|Special
7|4|Conjure Earth Elemental|When a druid casts a Conjure Earth Elemental spell, he or she summons an earth elemental of 16 hit dice to do the druid's bidding. Furthermore, the druid need but command it, and then do as he or she desires, for the elemental does not regard the druid who conjured it with enmity. The elemental remains until destroyed, dispelled, or sent away by dismissal (cf. Conjure Fire Elemental).|10|10n|VSM|None
7|5|Control Weather|The druidic Control Weather spell is more powerful than the clerical spell of the same name (q.v.). The spell caster is able to change weather by two places from the prevailing conditions if greater mistletoe is used. It otherwise is the same as the 7th level cleric Control Weather spell. |10|8d12 hours|VSM|None
7|6|Creeping Doom|" When the druid utters the spell of Creeping Doom, he or she calls forth a mass of from 500 to 1000 (d6 + 4) venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects and myriapods. This carpet-like mass will swarm in an area of 2"" square, and upon command from the druid will creep forth at 1"" per round towards any prey within 8"", moving in the direction in which the druid commanded. The Creeping Doom will slay any creature subject to normal attacks, each of the small horrors inflicting 1 hit point of damage (each then dies after their attack), to that up to 1,000 hit points of damage can be inflicted on creatures within the path of the Creeping Doom. If the Creeping Doom goes beyond 8"" of the summoner, it loses 50 of its number for each 1"" beyond 8"", i.e. at 10"" its number has shrunk by 100. There are a number of ways to thwart or destroy the creatures forming the swarm, all of which methods should be obvious. "|0.9|4n|VSM|None
7|7|Finger of Death|The Finger Of Death spell causes the victim's heart to stop. The druid utters the incantation, points his or her index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim succeeds in making the appropriate saving throw, death occurs. A successful saving throw negates the spell. |0.5|P|VSM|Neg.
7|8|Fire Storm|"When a Fire Storm spell is cast by a druid, a whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame which are equal to a Wall Of Fire (q.v.) in effect. Creatures within the area of fire and 1"" or less from the edge of the affected area receive 2 to 16 hit points of damage plus additional hit points equal to the number of levels of experience of the druid unless they make a saving throw, in which case they take only one-half damage. The area of effect is equal to 2 cubic"" per level of the druid, i.e. a 13th level druid can cast a Fire Storm which measures 13"" by 2"" by 1"". The height of the storm is 1"" or 2""; the balance of its area must be in length and width. The reverse spell, Fire Quench, smothers double the area of effect of a Fire Storm with respect to normal fires, and with respect to magical fires it has a 5% chance per level of the caster of extinguishing a magical fire (such as a Fire Storm) of proportions up to the normal area of effect of the non-reversed spell."|0.9|1|VSM|Half
7|9|Reincarnate| Druids have the capability of bringing back the dead in another body if death occurred no more than a week before the casting of the spell. The person reincarnated will recall the majority of his or her former life and form, but the class they have, if any, in their new incarnation might be different indeed. Abilities and speech are likewise often changed. |10|P|VSM|None
7|10|Transmute Metal to Wood| The Transmute Metal To Wood spell allows the druid casting it to change an object from metal to wood. The volume of metal is equal to a maximum weight of 80 gold pieces per level of experience. Magical objects of metal are only 10% likely to be affected by the spell. Note that even a Dispel Magic spell will not reverse the spell effects. Thus, a metal door changed to wood would be forevermore a wooden door.|0.9|P|VSM|Special
