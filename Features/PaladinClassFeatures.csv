You are A CHAMPION OF GOOD. If you CONCENTRATE, you can DETECT EVIL up to 60’ around you. The DM will tell you approximately where any EVIL INFLUENCES are.
You are A TRUE KNIGHT. If you LAY HANDS on a wounded person, they regain 2 HIT POINTS per LEVEL you have achieved. Also, you may CURE a person’s DISEASE completely. Each of these effects may only be used once.
You are SWORN TO A RIGHTEOUS OATH. If you exhibit SINFUL GREED or commit EVIL DEEDS, you lose all PALADIN FEATURES immediately. Change your CLASS to OATHBREAKER, and henceforth take a -2 penalty to your SAVING THROWS. Your DM will tell you when you have crossed the line.
