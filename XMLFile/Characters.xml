					<s_name>Protection From Evil </s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is cast, it acts as if it were a magical armour upon the recipient. The protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or conjured nature such as aerial servants, demons, devils, djinn, efreet, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, night hags, quasits, salamanders, water weirds, wind walkers, and xorn. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected creature. Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by evil creatures incur a penalty of -2 from dice rolls "to hit" the protected creature, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected creature's dice. This spell can be reversed to become Protection From Good, although it still keeps out enchanted evil creatures as well. To complete this spell, the cleric must truce a 3' diameter circle upon the floor (or ground) with holy water for Protection From Evil, with blood for Protection From Good - or in the air using burning incense or smouldering dung with respect to evil/good. </s_text>

					<s_name>Command </s_name>
					<s_text>This spell enables the cleric to issue a command of a single word. The command must be uttered in a language which the spell recipient is able to understand. The individual will obey to the best of his/her/its ability only so long as the command is absolutely clear and unequivocal, i.e. "Suicide!" could be a noun, so the creature would ignore the command. A command to "Die!" would cause the recipient to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for 1 round, but thereafter the creature would be alive and well. Typical command words are: back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, fly, go, leave, surrender, sleep. rest, etc. Undead are not affected by a command. Creatures with intelligence of 13 or more, and creatures with 6 or more hit dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw versus magic. (Creatures with 13 or higher intelligence and 6 hit dice/levels do not get 2 saving throws!) </s_text>

					<s_text>A Know Alignment spell enables the cleric to exactly read the aura of a person - human, semi-human, or non-human. This will reveal the exact alignment of the person. Up to 10 persons can be examined with this spell. The reverse totally obscures alignment, even from this spell, of a single person for 1 turn, two persons for 5 rounds, etc. Certain magical devices will negate the ability to Know Alignment. </s_text>

					<s_name>Sanctuary </s_name>
					<s_text>When the cleric casts a Sanctuary spell, any opponent must make a saving throw versus magic in order to strike or otherwise attack him or her. If the saving throw is not made, the creature will attack another and totally ignore the cleric protected by the spell. If the saving throw is made, the cleric is subject to normal attack process including dicing for weapons to hit, saving throws, damage. Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks (Fireball, Ice Storm, etc.). During the period of protection afforded by this spell, the cleric cannot take offensive action, but he or she may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way which does not violate the prohibition against offensive action, This allows the cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a light in the area (not upon on opponent!), and so on, The components of the spell include the cleric's holy/unholy symbol and a small silver mirror. </s_text>

					<s_name>Resist Fire</s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is placed upon a creature by a cleric, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat, and boiling temperature is comfortable. The recipient of the resist tire spell can even stand in the midst of very hot or magical fires such as those produced by red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, fire storms, fire balls, meteor swarms. or red dragon's breath - but these will affect the creature, to some extent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus of +3 an saving throws against such attack forms, and all damage sustained is reduced by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is not made, the creature sustains one-half damage, and if the saving throw is mode only one-quarter damage is sustained, Resistance to fire lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric placing the spell. The caster needs a drop of mercury as the material component of this spell.  </s_text>

					<s_name>Spiritual Hammer</s_name>
					<s_text>By calling upon his or her deity, the cleric casting a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force which is shaped vaguely like a hammer. This area of force is hammer-sized, and as long as the cleric who invoked it concentrates upon the hammer, it will strike at any opponent within its range as desired by the cleric. The force area strikes as a magical weapon equal to one plus per 3 levels of experience of the spell caster for purposes of being able to strike creatures, although it has no magical plusses whatsoever "to hit", and the damage it causes when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, i.e. 1-6 versus opponents of man-sire or smaller, 1-4 upon larger opponents. Furthermore, the hammer strikes at exactly the same level as the cleric controlling it, just as if the cleric was personally wielding the weapon. As soon as the cleric ceases concentration, the Spiritual Hammer is dispelled. Note: If the cleric is behind an opponent, the force can strike from this position, thus gaining all bonuses for such an attack and negating defensive protections such as shield and dexterity. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer which the cleric must hurl towards opponents whilst uttering a plea to his or her deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast. </s_text>

					<s_name>Glyph of Warding</s_name>
					<s_text>A Glyph of Warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. When the spell is cast, the cleric weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every square foot of area to be protected, 1 segment of time is required to trace the warding lines from the glyph, plus the initial segment during which the sigil itself is traced. A maximum of a 5' X 5' area per level can be warded. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible, but any creature touching the protected area without first speaking the name of the glyph the cleric has used to serve as a ward will be subject to the magic it stores. Saving throws apply, and will either reduce effects by one-half or negate them according to the glyph employed. The cleric must use incense to trace this spell, and then sprinkle the area with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 g.p. worth) if it exceeds 50 square feet. Typical glyphs shock for 2 points of electrical damage per level of the spell caster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, or even drain a life energy level (if the cleric is of high enough level to cast this glyph). </s_text>

					<s_name>Write</s_name>
					<s_text>By means of this spell a magic-user might be able to inscribe a spell to make a magical scroll he or she cannot understand at the time (due to level or lack of sufficient intelligence) into the tome or other compilation he or she employs to maintain a library of spells. The magic-user must make a saving throw versus magic to attempt the writing of any spell, +2 if it is only up to 1 level greater than he or she currently uses, 0 at 2 levels higher, and -1 per level from 3 levels higher onwards. If this throw fails, the magic user is subject to 1d4 of damage for every level of the spell he or she was attempting to transcribe into his or her magic book, and furthermore be knocked unconscious for a like number of turns. This damage, if not fatal, can only be healed at the rate of 1-4 points per day, as it is damage to psyche and body. Furthermore, a spell will take 1 hour per level to transcribe in this fashion, and during this period, the magic-user is in a trance state and can always be surprised by any foe. In addition to the writing surface upon which the spell is to be transcribed, the spell caster needs a fine ink composed of rare substances (minimum cost 200 g.p. per bottle, if available at all without manufacture by the magic user). </s_text>

					<s_name>Read Magic</s_name>
					<s_text>By means of a Read Magic spell, the magic-user is able to read magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls weapons and the like - which would otherwise be totally unintelligible to him or her. (The personal books of the magic-user, and works already magically read, are intelligible.) This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a curse scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the magic-user has read the magical inscription, he or she is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of the Read Magic spell. The duration of the spell is 2 rounds per level of experience of the spell caster. The material component for the spell is a clear crystal or mineral prism. Note that the material is not expended by use. The reverse of the spell, Unreadable Magic, makes such writing completely unreadable to any creature, even with the aid of a Read Magic, until the spell wears off or the magic is dispelled. The material components for the reverse spell are a pinch of dirt and a drop of water.</s_text>

					<s_name>Invisibility</s_name>
					<s_text>This spell causes the recipient to vanish from sight and not be detectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced with respect to noises normal to it. The spell remains In effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, or the magic-user or the other recipient cancels it or until he, she or it attacks any creature. Thus, the spell caster or recipient could open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if any form of attack is made, the invisible creature immediately becomes visible, although this will allow the first attack by the creature because of the former invisibility. Even the allies of the spell recipient cannot see the invisible creature, or his, her or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Note that all highly intelligent creatures with 10 or more hit dice, or levels of experience, or the equivalent in intelligence/dice/levels have a chance to automatically detect invisible objects. The material components of the Invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter. </s_text>

The burning hands send out flame jets of 3' length in a horizontal arc of about 120° in front of the magic-user. Any creature in the area of flames takes 1 hit point of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster, and no saving throw is possible.

					<s_name>Dispel Magic</s_name>
					<s_text>When a cleric casts this spell, it neutralizes or negates the magic it comes in contact with as follows: A Dispel Magic will not affect a specially enchanted item such as a scroll, magic ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous magic item, magic weapon, magic shield, or magic armour. It will destroy magic potions (they are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell), remove spells cast upon persons or objects, or counter the casting of spells in the area of effect. The base chance for success of a Dispel Magic spell is 50%. For every level of experience of the character casting the Dispel Magic above that of the creature whose magic is to be dispelled (or above the efficiency level of the object from which the magic is issuing), the base chance increases by 5%, so that if there are 10 levels of difference, there is a 100% chance. For every level below the experience/efficiency level of the creature/object, the base chance is reduced by 2%. Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. It is automatic in negating the spell caster's own magic. </s_text>

					<s_name>Detect Magic </s_name>
					<s_text>When the Detect Magic spell is cast, the cleric detects magical radiations in a path 1" wide, and up to 3", long, in the direction he or she is facing. The caster can turn 60° per round. Note that stone walls of 1' or more thickness, solid metal of but 1/12' thickness, or 3' or more of solid wood will black the spell. The spell requires the use of the cleric's holy (or unholy) symbol. </s_text>

					<s_name>Snake Charm </s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern is set up which causes one or more snakes to cease all activity except a semi-erect postured swaying movement. If the snakes are charmed while in a torpor, the duration of the spell is 3 to 6 turns (d4 + 2); if the snakes are not torpid, but are not aroused and angry, the charm lasts 1 to 3 turns; if the snakes are angry and/or attacking, the snake charm spell will last from 5 to 8 melee rounds (d4+4). The cleric casting the spell can charm snakes whose hit points are less than or equal to those of the cleric. On the average, a 1st level cleric could charm snakes with a total of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd level cleric 9 hit points, a 3rd level 13 or 14 hit points, etc. The hit points can represent a single snake or several of the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot exceed those of the cleric casting the spell. </s_text>

					<s_name>Cure Light Wounds</s_name>
					<s_text>Upon laying his or her hand upon a creature, the cleric causes from 1 to 8 hit points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing will not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor will it cure wounds of creatures not living or those which can be harmed only by iron, silver, and/or magical weapons. Its reverse, Cause Light Wounds, operates in the same manner; and if a person is avoiding this touch, a melee combat "to hit" die is rolled to determine if the cleric's hand strikes the opponent and causes such a wound. Note that cured wounds are permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage, and that caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury will. Caused light wounds are 1 to 8 hit points of damage. </s_text>

				<spell>
					<s_name>Spiritual Hammer</s_name>
					<s_text>By calling upon his or her deity, the cleric casting a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force which is shaped vaguely like a hammer. This area of force is hammer-sized, and as long as the cleric who invoked it concentrates upon the hammer, it will strike at any opponent within its range as desired by the cleric. The force area strikes as a magical weapon equal to one plus per 3 levels of experience of the spell caster for purposes of being able to strike creatures, although it has no magical plusses whatsoever "to hit", and the damage it causes when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, i.e. 1-6 versus opponents of man-sire or smaller, 1-4 upon larger opponents. Furthermore, the hammer strikes at exactly the same level as the cleric controlling it, just as if the cleric was personally wielding the weapon. As soon as the cleric ceases concentration, the Spiritual Hammer is dispelled. Note: If the cleric is behind an opponent, the force can strike from this position, thus gaining all bonuses for such an attack and negating defensive protections such as shield and dexterity. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer which the cleric must hurl towards opponents whilst uttering a plea to his or her deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast. </s_text>

				<spell>
					<s_name>Speak With Animals </s_name>
					<s_text>By employing this spell, the cleric is empowered to comprehend and communicate with any warm or cold-blooded animal which is not mindless (such as an amoeba). The cleric is able to ask questions, receive answers, and generally be on amicable terms with the animal. This ability lasts for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the cleric employing the spell. Even if the bent of the animal is opposite to that of the cleric (evil/good, good/evil), it and any others of the same kind with it will not attack while the spell lasts. If the animal is neutral or of the some general bent as the cleric (evil/evil, good/good), there is a possibility that the animal, and its like associates, will do some favour or service for the cleric. This possibility will be determined by the referee by consulting a special reaction chart, using the charisma of the cleric and his actions as the major determinants. Note that this spell differs from speak with monsters (q.v.), for it allows conversation only with basically normal, non-fantastic creatures such as apes, bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on. </s_text>

					<s_name>Create Food &amp; Water</s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is cast, the cleric causes food and/or water to appear. The food thus created is highly nourishing, and each cubic foot of the material will sustain three human-sized creatures or one horse-sized creature for a full day. For each level of experience the cleric has attained, 1 cubic foot of food and/or water is created by the spell, i.e. 2 cubic feet of food are created by a 2nd level cleric, 3 by a 3rd, 4 by a 4th, and so on; or the 2nd level cleric could create 1 cubic foot of food and 1 cubic foot of water, etc. </s_text>

					<s_name>Cure Light Wounds</s_name>
					<s_text>Upon laying his or her hand upon a creature, the cleric causes from 1 to 8 hit points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing will not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor will it cure wounds of creatures not living or those which can be harmed only by iron, silver, and/or magical weapons. Its reverse, Cause Light Wounds, operates in the same manner; and if a person is avoiding this touch, a melee combat "to hit" die is rolled to determine if the cleric's hand strikes the opponent and causes such a wound. Note that cured wounds are permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage, and that caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury will. Caused light wounds are 1 to 8 hit points of damage. </s_text>

				<spell>
					<s_name>Protection From Evil </s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is cast, it acts as if it were a magical armour upon the recipient. The protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or conjured nature such as aerial servants, demons, devils, djinn, efreet, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, night hags, quasits, salamanders, water weirds, wind walkers, and xorn. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected creature. Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by evil creatures incur a penalty of -2 from dice rolls "to hit" the protected creature, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected creature's dice. This spell can be reversed to become Protection From Good, although it still keeps out enchanted evil creatures as well. To complete this spell, the cleric must truce a 3' diameter circle upon the floor (or ground) with holy water for Protection From Evil, with blood for Protection From Good - or in the air using burning incense or smouldering dung with respect to evil/good. </s_text>

					<s_name>Spiritual Hammer</s_name>
					<s_text>By calling upon his or her deity, the cleric casting a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force which is shaped vaguely like a hammer. This area of force is hammer-sized, and as long as the cleric who invoked it concentrates upon the hammer, it will strike at any opponent within its range as desired by the cleric. The force area strikes as a magical weapon equal to one plus per 3 levels of experience of the spell caster for purposes of being able to strike creatures, although it has no magical plusses whatsoever "to hit", and the damage it causes when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, i.e. 1-6 versus opponents of man-sire or smaller, 1-4 upon larger opponents. Furthermore, the hammer strikes at exactly the same level as the cleric controlling it, just as if the cleric was personally wielding the weapon. As soon as the cleric ceases concentration, the Spiritual Hammer is dispelled. Note: If the cleric is behind an opponent, the force can strike from this position, thus gaining all bonuses for such an attack and negating defensive protections such as shield and dexterity. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer which the cleric must hurl towards opponents whilst uttering a plea to his or her deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast. </s_text>

					<s_name>Remove Fear</s_name>
					<s_text>By touch, the cleric instils courage in the spell recipient, raising the creature's saving throw against magical fear attacks by +4 on dice rolls for 1 turn. If the recipient has already been affected by fear, and failed the appropriate saving throw, the touch allows another saving throw to be made, with a bonus of +1 on the dice for every level of experience of the caster, i.e. a 2nd level cleric gives a +2 bonus, a 3rd level +3, etc. A "to hit" dice roll must be made to touch an unwilling recipient. The reverse of the spell, Cause Fear, causes the victim to flee in panic at maximum movement speed away from the caster for 1 round per level of the cleric causing such fear. Of course, Cause Fear can be countered by Remove Fear and vice versa.</s_text>

				<spell>
					<s_name>Hold Person</s_name>
					<s_text>This spell holds immobile, and freezes in places, from 1-3 humans or humanoid creatures (see below) for 5 or more melee rounds. The level of the cleric casting the Hold Person spell dictates the length of time the effect will last. The basic duration is 5 melee rounds at 1st level, 6 rounds at 2nd level, 7 rounds at 3rd level, etc. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a saving throw at the normal score; if only two persons are being enspelled, each makes their saving throw at -1 on their die; if the spell is cast at but one person, the saving throw die is at -2. Persons making their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Creatures affected by a Hold Person spell are: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, and troglodytes. The spell caster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell. </s_text>

					<s_name>Chant </s_name>
					<s_text>By means of the chant, the cleric brings into being a special favour upon himself or herself and his or her party, and causes harm to his or her enemies. Once the Chant spell is completed, all attacks, damage and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the cleric are at +1, while those of the cleric's enemies are at -1. This bonus/penalty continues as long as the cleric continues to chant the mystic syllables and is stationary. An interruption, however, such as an attack which succeeds and causes damage, grappling the chanter, or a magical silence, will break the spell. </s_text>

				<spell>
					<s_name>Cure Blindness</s_name>
					<s_text>By touching the creature afflicted, the cleric employing the spell can permanently cure most forms of blindness. Its reverse, Cause Blindness, requires a successful touch upon the victim, and if the victim then makes the saving throw, the effect is negated. </s_text>
					<s_cast>1</s_cast>

					<s_name>Light </s_name>
					<s_text>This spell causes excitation of molecules so as to make them brightly luminous. The light thus caused is equal to torch light in brightness, but its sphere is limited to 4" in diameter. It lasts for the duration indicated (7 turns at 1st experience level, 8 at 2nd, 9 at 3rd, etc.) or until the caster utters a word to extinguish the light. The Light spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions, except the blackness persists for only one half the duration that light would last. If this spell is cast upon a creature, the applicable magic resistance and saving throw dice rolls must be made. Success indicates that the spell affects the area immediately behind the creature, rather than the creature itself. In all other cases, the spell takes effect where the caster directs as long as he or she has a line of sight or unobstructed path for the spell; fight can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance.</s_text>

					<s_name>Sanctuary </s_name>
					<s_text>When the cleric casts a Sanctuary spell, any opponent must make a saving throw versus magic in order to strike or otherwise attack him or her. If the saving throw is not made, the creature will attack another and totally ignore the cleric protected by the spell. If the saving throw is made, the cleric is subject to normal attack process including dicing for weapons to hit, saving throws, damage. Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks (Fireball, Ice Storm, etc.). During the period of protection afforded by this spell, the cleric cannot take offensive action, but he or she may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way which does not violate the prohibition against offensive action, This allows the cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a light in the area (not upon on opponent!), and so on, The components of the spell include the cleric's holy/unholy symbol and a small silver mirror. </s_text>

					<s_name>Hold Person</s_name>
					<s_text>This spell holds immobile, and freezes in places, from 1-3 humans or humanoid creatures (see below) for 5 or more melee rounds. The level of the cleric casting the Hold Person spell dictates the length of time the effect will last. The basic duration is 5 melee rounds at 1st level, 6 rounds at 2nd level, 7 rounds at 3rd level, etc. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a saving throw at the normal score; if only two persons are being enspelled, each makes their saving throw at -1 on their die; if the spell is cast at but one person, the saving throw die is at -2. Persons making their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Creatures affected by a Hold Person spell are: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, and troglodytes. The spell caster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell. </s_text>

					<s_name>Detect Evil </s_name>
					<s_text>This is a spell which discovers emanations of evil, or of good in the case of the reverse spell, from any creature or object. For example, evil alignment or an evilly cursed object will radiate evil, but a hidden trop or an unintelligent viper will not. The duration of a Detect Evil (or Detect Good) spell is 1 turn + ½ turn (5 rounds, or 5 minutes) per level of the cleric. Thus a cleric of 1st level of experience can cast a spell with a 1½ turn duration, at 2nd level a 2 turn duration, 2½ at 3rd, etc. The spell has a path of detection 1" wide in the direction in which the cleric is facing. It requires the use of the cleric's holy (or unholy) symbol as its material component, with the cleric holding it before him or her. </s_text>

					<s_name>Slow Poison</s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual it greatly slows the effects of any venom, even causing a supposedly dead individual to have life restored if it is cast upon the victim within a number of turns less than or equal to the level of experience of the cleric after the poisoning was suffered. i.e. a victim poisoned up to 10 turns previously could be temporarily saved by a 10th or higher level cleric who cast Slow Poison upon the victim. While this spell does not neutralize the venom, it does prevent it from substantially harming the individual for the duration of its magic, but each turn the poisoned creature will lose 1 hit point from the effect of the venom (although the victim will never go below 1 hit point while the Slow Poison spell's duration lasts). Thus, in the example above, the victim poisoned 10 turns previously has only 10 hit points, so when the 10th level cleric casts the spell, the victim remains with 1 hit point until the spell duration expires, and hopefully during that period a full cure can be accomplished. The material components of this spell are the cleric's holy/unholy symbol and a bud of garlic which must be crushed and smeared on the victim's bare feet. </s_text>

Up to 10 persons can be examined with this spell. The reverse totally obscures alignment, even from this spell, of a single person for 1 turn, two persons for 5 rounds, etc. Certain magical devices will negate the ability to Know Alignment. </s_text>

For each level of experience the cleric has attained, 1 cubic foot of food and/or water is created by the spell, i.e. 2 cubic feet of food are created by a 2nd level cleric, 3 by a 3rd, 4 by a 4th, and so on; or the 2nd level cleric could create 1 cubic foot of food and 1 cubic foot of water, etc. </s_text>

					<s_name>Protection From Evil </s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is cast, it acts as if it were a magical armour upon the recipient. The protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or conjured nature such as aerial servants, demons, devils, djinn, efreet, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, night hags, quasits, salamanders, water weirds, wind walkers, and xorn. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected creature. Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by evil creatures incur a penalty of -2 from dice rolls "to hit" the protected creature, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected creature's dice. This spell can be reversed to become Protection From Good, although it still keeps out enchanted evil creatures as well. To complete this spell, the cleric must truce a 3' diameter circle upon the floor (or ground) with holy water for Protection From Evil, with blood for Protection From Good - or in the air using burning incense or smouldering dung with respect to evil/good. </s_text>

Reversing the spell, Destroy Water, obliterates without trace (such as vapour, mist, fog or steam) a like quantity of water. Created water will last until normally used or evaporated, spilled, etc. Water can be created or destroyed in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid or in an area as large as 27 cubic feet (one cubic yard). The spell requires at least a drop of water to create, or a pinch of dust to destroy, water. Note that water cannot be created within a living thing.</s_text>

					<s_text>The cleric casting an Augury spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate future (within 3 turns) will be for the benefit of, or harmful to, the party. The base chance for correctly divining the augury is 70%, plus 1% far each level of the cleric casting the spell, i.e. 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc, Your referee will determine any adjustments due far the particular conditions of each augury. For example, assume that a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal which closes a portal. Augury is used to find if weal or woe will be the ultimate result to the party. The material component for Augury is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens, or the wet leaves of on infusion which remain in the container after the infused brew is consumed. If the last method is used, a crushed pearl of at least 100 g.p. value must be added to the concoction before it is consumed. </s_text>

					<s_name>Spiritual Hammer</s_name>
					<s_text>By calling upon his or her deity, the cleric casting a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force which is shaped vaguely like a hammer. This area of force is hammer-sized, and as long as the cleric who invoked it concentrates upon the hammer, it will strike at any opponent within its range as desired by the cleric. The force area strikes as a magical weapon equal to one plus per 3 levels of experience of the spell caster for purposes of being able to strike creatures, although it has no magical plusses whatsoever "to hit", and the damage it causes when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, i.e. 1-6 versus opponents of man-sire or smaller, 1-4 upon larger opponents. Furthermore, the hammer strikes at exactly the same level as the cleric controlling it, just as if the cleric was personally wielding the weapon. As soon as the cleric ceases concentration, the Spiritual Hammer is dispelled. Note: If the cleric is behind an opponent, the force can strike from this position, thus gaining all bonuses for such an attack and negating defensive protections such as shield and dexterity. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer which the cleric must hurl towards opponents whilst uttering a plea to his or her deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast. </s_text>

					<s_name>Dispel Magic </s_name>

It will destroy magic potions (they are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell), remove spells cast upon persons or objects, or counter the casting of spells in the area of effect. The base chance for success of a Dispel Magic spell is 50%. For every level of experience of the character casting the Dispel Magic above that of the creature whose magic is to be dispelled (or above the efficiency level of the object from which the magic is issuing), the base chance increases by 5%, so that if there are 10 levels of difference, there is a 100% chance. For every level below the experience/efficiency level of the creature/object, the base chance is reduced by 2%. Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. It is automatic in negating the spell caster's own magic. </s_text>

The Shield also adds +1 to the magic-user's saving throw dice vs. attacks which are basically frontal.

If the spell is cast upon the person of the magic-user, he or she can move vertically at a rate of 20' per round. If cast upon another creature, the magic-user can levitate it at a maximum vertical movement of 10' per round. Horizontal movement is not empowered by this spell, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, far example, to move laterally. The spell caster can cancel the spell as desired. If the recipient of the spell is unwilling, that creature is entitled to a saving throw to determine if the Levitate spell affects it. The material component of this spell is either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end. </s_text>

The spell does not enable the wizard to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the wizard will be viewed in its most favourable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the wizard if assured that the only chance to save the druid's life is if the creature holds back an onrushing red dragon for "just a round or two". Note also that the spell does not empower the druid with linguistic capabilities beyond those he or she normally possesses. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a saving throw is made, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's intelligence: </s_text>

The frightened creature will not drop any items held unless it is encumbered. If cornered, the spell recipient will fight, but at -1 on "to hit" and damage dice rolls and all saving throws as well. Note that this spell does not have any effect on elves, half-elves, the undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, shadows, ghosts, wights, wraiths), larvae, lemures, manes, or clerics of any sort. The material component used for this spell is a bit of bone from an undead skeleton, zombie, ghoul, ghost or mummy. </s_text>

					<s_name>Push</s_name>
					<s_text>Upon pronouncing the syllables of this spell, the magic-user causes an invisible force to strike against whatever object he or she is pointing at. The force of the Push is not great, being 1 foot- pound per level of the magic-user casting the spell, but it can move small objects up to 1' in a direction directly away from the caster, topple an object under the proper conditions, or cause a creature to lose its balance. An example of the latter use is causing a creature attacking to lose its balance when it is attacking, for if the creature fails its saving throw, it will not be able to attack that round. Of course, the mass of the creature attacking cannot exceed the force of the Push by more than a factor of 50, i.e. a 1st level magic-user cannot effectively push a creature weighing more than 50 pounds. A Push spell employed against an object held by a creature will cause it to subtract the force of the spell in foot- pounds (1,2,3, etc.) from its chance to hit or add to opponent saving throws as applicable if the creature fails to make its saving throw against magic when the spell is cast. The material component of this spell is a small pinch of powdered brass which must be blown from the palm prior to pointing at the object of the spell.</s_text>

					<s_name>Gust of Wind</s_name>
					<s_text>When this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the magic-user and moves in the direction he or she is facing. The force of this Gust Of Wind is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It will cause protected -flames such as those of lanterns to wildly dance and has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spell caster to extinguish even such lights. It will also fan large fires outwards 1' to 6' in the direction of the wind's movement. It will force back small flying creatures 1" to 6" and cause man-sized ones to be held motionless if attempting to move into its force, and similarly slow large flying creatures by 50% for 1 round. It will blow over light objects. Its path is 1" wide by 1" of length per level of experience of the magic-user casting the Gust Of Wind spell i.e. an 8th level magic-user causes a Gust Of Wind which travels 8". The material component of the spell is a legume seed. </s_text>
